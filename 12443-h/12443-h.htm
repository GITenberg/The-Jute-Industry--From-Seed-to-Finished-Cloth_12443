<h2><a name="gPREF" href="#PREFg">PREFACE</a></h2>
<p>The sub-title of this little volume indicates that practically
all the processes involved in the cultivation of jute plants, the
extraction of the fibre, and the transformation of the fibre into
useful commodities, have been considered. In addition, every
important branch of this wide industry is liberally illustrated,
and the description, although not severely technical, is
sufficiently so to enable students, or those with no previous
knowledge of the subject, to follow the operations intelligently,
and to become more or less acquainted with the general routine of
jute manufacture. As a matter of fact, the work forms a medium of
study for textile students, and a suitable introduction to the
more detailed literature by the authors on these textile
subjects.</p>

<h2>THE JUTE INDUSTRY</h2>
<h3>FROM SEED TO FINISHED CLOTH</h3>
<br>
<h2><a name="gINTR" href="#INTRg">CHAPTER I.
INTRODUCTORY</a></h2>
<p>The five main fibres used for ordinary textile purposes are
cotton, flax, jute, silk and wool; in this group jute has been
considered in general as being of the least value, not only in
regard to price, but also in regard to utility. It is only under
phenomenal conditions which arise from a great upheaval such as
that which took place during the world's great war from 1914
onwards that, from a commercial point of view, the extreme
importance of the jute fibre and its products are fully realized.
Millions of sand bags were made from the year 1914 to the year
1918 solely for military purposes, while huge quantities of jute
cloth were utilized as the covering material for food stuffs of
various kinds, thus liberating the other textile fibres and cloth
for equally important purposes. It is on record that in one short
period of fourteen days, 150,000,000 sand-bags were collected,
packed and despatched from Dundee to be used as protective
elements in various ways and seats of conflict.</p>
<p>A glance into the records of the textile industries will
reveal the fact that the jute fibre was practically unknown in
these islands a hundred years ago. Unsuccessful attempts were
certainly made to import the fibre into Great Britain in the
latter part of the 18th century, and it has been used in India
for centuries in the making of cord, twine and coarse fabrics,
because the fibre is indigenous to that country. And since all
the manufacturing methods there, for a considerable time were
manual ones, the industry--if such it could be called--moved
along slowly, providing employment only for the needs of a small
section of the community on the Eastern shores.</p>
<p>The first small imports of jute fibre were due to the
instigation of Dr. Roxburgh and the East India Company, but it
was only after repeated requests that any attempt was made to
utilize the samples of jute for practical experiments The fibre
was so unlike any of the existing staples that those interested
in textiles were not anxious to experiment with it, but
ultimately they were persuaded to do so; these persistent
requests for trials, and the interest which was finally aroused,
formed the nucleus of the existing important jute industry.</p>
<p>Apart from the above-mentioned efforts, the introduction of
the jute fibre into Great Britain was delayed until 1822, when
the first small consignment reached Dundee--now the Western home
of the jute industry. This quantity was imported into this
country with the special object of having it treated by
mechanical means, much in the same way as flax fibre was being
treated. At this period Dundee was a comparatively important
textile centre in regard to the spinning and weaving of flax and
hemp; it was, in consequence, only natural that the longer, but
otherwise apparently similar and coarser, jute fibre should be
submitted to the machinery in vogue for the preparation and
spinning of flax and hemp. When we say similar, we mean in
general appearance; it is now well-known that there is a
considerable difference between jute fibre and those of hemp and
flax, and hence the modifications in preparation which had
ultimately to be introduced to enable the jute fibre to be
successfully treated. These modifications shall be discussed at a
later stage.</p>
<p>It might be stated that while only 368 cwt. of jute fibre was
reported as being shipped from Calcutta to this country in 1828,
the imports gradually increased as time passed on. The yarns
which were made from the fibre were heavier or thicker than those
in demand for the usual types of cloth, and it was desirable that
other types of cloth should be introduced so that these yarns
could be utilized. About the year 1838, representatives of the
Dutch Government placed comparatively large orders with the
manufacturers for jute bags to be used for carrying the crop of
coffee beans from their West Indian possessions. The subsequent
rapid growth of the industry, and the demand for newer types of
cloth, are perhaps due more to the above fortunate experiment
than to any other circumstance.</p>
<p>By the year or season 1850-51, the British imports of jute
fibre had increased to over 28,000 tons, and they reached 46,000
tons in the season 1860-61. Attention meanwhile had been directed
to the possibility of manufacturing jute goods by machinery in
India--the seat of the cultivation and growth of the fibre. At
least such a probability was anticipated, for in the year 1858 a
small consignment of machinery was despatched to Calcutta, and an
attempt made to produce the gunny bags which were typical of the
Indian native industry.</p>
<p>The great difference between the more or less unorganized hand
labour and the essential organization of modern mills and
factories soon became apparent, for in the first place it was
difficult to induce the natives to remain inside the works during
the period of training, and equally difficult to keep the trained
operatives constantly employed. Monetary affairs induced them to
leave the mills and factories for their more usual mode of living
in the country.</p>
<p>In the face of these difficulties, however, the industry grew
in India as well as in Dundee. For several years before the war,
the quantity of raw jute fibre brought to Dundee and other
British ports amounted to 200,000 tons. During the same period
preceding the war, nearly 1,000,000 tons were exported to various
countries, while the Indian annual consumption--due jointly to
the home industry and the mills in the vicinity of
Calcutta--reached the same huge total of one million tons.</p>
<p>The growth of the jute industry in several parts of the world,
and consequently its gradually increasing importance in regard to
the production of yarns and cloth for various purposes, enables
it to be ranked as one of the important industries in the textile
group, and one which may perhaps attain a much more important
position in the near future amongst our national manufacturing
processes. As a matter of fact, at the present time, huge
extensions are contemplated and actually taking place in
India.</p>

<h2><a name="gCULT" href="#CULTg">CHAPTER II.
CULTIVATION</a></h2>
<p><b>Botanical and Physical Features of the Plant</b>. Jute
fibre is obtained from two varieties of plants which appear to
differ only in the shape of the fruit or seed vessel. Thus, the
fruit of the variety <i>Corchorus Capsularis</i> is enclosed in a
capsule of approximately circular section, whereas the fruit of
the variety <i>Corchorus Olitorius</i> is contained in a pod.
Both belong to the order <i>Tiliacea</i>, and are annuals
cultivated mostly in Bengal and Assam.</p>
<p>Other varieties are recorded, e.g. the <i>Corchorus
Japonicus</i> of Japan, and the <i>Corchorus Mompoxensis</i> used
in Panama for making a kind of tea, while one variety of jute
plant is referred to in the book of job as the Jew's Mallow; this
variety <i>C. Olitorius</i>, has been used in the East from time
immemorial as a pot herb.</p>
<p>The two main varieties <i>C. Capsularis</i> and <i>C.
Olilorius</i> are cultivated in Bengal for the production of
fibre, while for seed purposes, large tracts of land are
cultivated in Assam, and the seeds exported for use principally
in Mymensingh and Dacca.</p>
<p>The above two varieties of the jute plant vary in height from
5 to 15 feet, and, in a normal season, reach maturity in about
four months from the time of sowing. In some districts the stems
of jute plants are sometimes rather dark in colour, but, in
general, they are green or pink, and straight with a tendency to
branch. The leaves are alternate on the stems, 4 to 5 inches in
length, and about 1-1/2 inches in breadth with serrated edges.
Pale yellow flowers spring from the axil (axilla) of the leaves,
and there is an abundance of small seeds in the fruit which, as
mentioned, is characteristic of the variety.</p>
<p>While many attempts have been made to cultivate jute plants in
various parts of the world, the results seem to indicate that the
necessary conditions for the successful cultivation of them are
completely fulfilled only in the Bengal area, and the
geographical position of this province is mainly responsible for
these conditions. On referring to a map of India, it will be seen
that Bengal is directly north of the bay of that name, and is
bounded on the north by the great Himalayan mountains.</p>
<p>During the winter period when the prevailing winds are from
the north, large areas of the mountainous regions are covered
with snow, but when the winds change and come from the south, and
particularly during the warmer weather, the moist warm air raises
the general temperature and also melts much of the snow on the
mountain tracts. The rain and melted snow swell the two great
rivers on the east and west of Bengal--the Patna and the
Brahmaputra--and the tremendous volume of water carries down
decayed vegetable and animal matter which is ultimately spread on
the flat areas of Bengal as alluvial deposits, and thus provides
an ideal layer of soil for the propagation of the jute
plants.</p>
<p>The cultivation of land for the growing of jute plants is most
extensively conducted in the centres bordering on the courses of
the rivers, and particularly in Mymensingh, Dacca, Hooghly and
Pabna, and while 90 per cent. of the fibre is produced in Bengal,
Orissa and Bihar, there is 10 per cent. produced outside these
areas.</p>
<p>The <i>Corchorus Capsularis</i> variety is usually cultivated
in the higher and richer soils, while the <i>Corchorus
Olitorius</i> variety is most suited for the lower-lying alluvial
soils, and to the districts where the rainfall is irregular;
indeed, the <i>C. Olitorius</i> may be grown in certain other
districts of India which appear quite unsuitable for the <i>C.
Capsularis</i>.</p>
<p>The farming operations in India are rather simple when
compared with the corresponding operations in this country; there
is evidently not the same necessity for extensive working of the
Indian soil as there is for the heavier lands; another reason for
the primitive Eastern methods may be the absence of horses.</p>
<p>The ploughs are made of wood and faced with iron. Bullocks, in
teams of two or more, are harnessed to the plough as shown in
Fig. 1 where a field is being ploughed as a preliminary process
in jute cultivation. The bullocks draw the plough in much the
same way as horses do in this country.</p>
<p>The operation of ploughing breaks up the soil, while the rough
clods may be broken by hand mallets or by the use of the
"hengha"--a piece of tree boll harnessed at the ends to a pair of
bullocks.</p>
<p>The breaking up of the land prepares it for the cleaning
process which is performed by what are termed "ladders"; these
ladders are made of a few bamboos fixed cross-wise and provided
with projecting pins to scratch or open the soil, and to collect
the roots of the previous crop; they are the equivalent of our
harrows, and may be used repeatedly during the winter and spring
seasons so that a fine tilth may be produced.</p>
<p>When manure is essential, it is applied in the later
ploughings, but other large areas have artificial or chemical
manures added at similar stages in the process. Farm-yard manure
is preferred, but castor-cake and the water hyacinth--a
weed--constitute good substitutes.</p>
<p>After the soil has been satisfactorily prepared, the seed is
sown by hand at the period which appears most suitable for the
particular district. The usual sowing time is from February to
the end of May, and even in June in some districts where late
crops can be obtained.</p>

</p>
<h3>FIG. 1 NATIVES PLOUGHING THE GROUND</h3>
<p>There are early and late varieties of the plants, and a
carefully judged distribution of the varieties of seed over the
districts for the growing period will not only yield a succession
of crops for easy harvesting, but will also help the farmer in
the selection of seeds for other areas where atmospheric
conditions differ.</p>
<p>It is a good practice, where possible, to sow the seed in two
directions at right angles to each other, and thus secure as
uniform a distribution as possible. The amount of seed used
depends partly upon the district, and in general from 10 lbs. to
30 lbs. per acre are sown. The seed may cost about 8 annas or
more per ser (about 2 lbs.).</p>

</a><br>
</p>
<h3>FIG. 2 BREAKING UP THE SOIL, OR "LADDERING"</h3>
<p>Plants should be specially cultivated for the production of
seed in order to obtain the best results from these seeds for
fibre plants. Many of the ryots (farmers) use seed which has been
collected from plants grown from inferior seed, or from odd and
often poor plants; they also grow plants year after year on the
same soil. The fibres obtained, as a rule, and as a result of
this method of obtaining seeds, gradually deteriorate; much
better results accrue when succession of crops and change of seed
are carefully attended to.</p>
<p>If the weather conditions are favourable, the seeds will
germinate in 8 to 10 days, after which the plants grow rapidly.
The heat and showers of rain combined soon form a crust on the
soil which should be broken; this is done by means of another
ladder provided with long pins, and Fig. 2 illustrates the
operation in process. This second laddering process opens up the
soil and allows the moisture and heat to enter. The young plants
are now thinned, and the ground weeded periodically, until the
plants reach a sufficient height or strength to prevent the words
from spreading.</p>
<p>The space between the growing plants will vary according to
the region; if there is a tendency to slow growth, there is an
abundance of plants; whereas, the thinning is most severe where
the plants show prospects of growing thick and tall.</p>
<p>In a normal season the plants will reach maturity in about 3
1/2 to 4 months from the time of sowing. Although different
opinions are held as to the best time for harvesting, that when
the fruits are setting appears to be most in favour; plants
harvested at this stage usually yield a large quantity of good
fibre which can be perfectly cleaned, and which is of good
spinning quality.</p>
<p>The plants are cut down by hand and with home-made knives; in
general, these knives are of crude manufacture, but they appear
to be quite suitable for the purpose. A field of jute plants
ready for cutting will certainly form a delightful picture, but
the prospect of the operation of cutting indicates a formidable
piece of work since it requires about 10 to 14 tons of the green
crop to produce about 10 to 15 cwt. of clean dry fibre.</p>
<hr>
<h2><a name="gRETT" href="#RETTg">CHAPTER III. RETTING</a></h2>
<p>The method of separating the bast layer (in which the fibres
are embedded) from the stem of the plant requires a large supply
of water, since the plants must be completely submerged in the
water for a period varying from 8 to 30 days; such time is
dependent upon the period of the year and upon the district in
which the operation is performed.</p>
<p>The above operation of detaching the bast layer from the stem
is technically known as "retting," and a good type of retting or
steeping place is an off-set of a run, branch, or stream where
the water moves slowly, or even remains at rest, during the time
the plants are under treatment.</p>
<p>The disintegration of the structural part of the plant is due
to a bacterial action, and gas is given off during the operation.
The farmer, or ryot, and his men know what progress the action is
making by the presence of the air bells which rise to the
surface; when the formation of air bells ceases, the men examine
the plants daily to see that the operation does not go too far,
otherwise the fibrous layer would be injured, and the resulting
fibre weak. The stems are tested in these examinations to see if
the fibrous layer, or bast layer, will strip off clean from the
wood or stem. When the ryot considers that the layers are
separated from the core sufficiently easy, the work of steeping
ceases, and the process of stripping is commenced immediately.
This latter process is conducted in various ways depending upon
the practice in vogue in the district.</p>
<p>In one area the men work amongst the water breaking up the
woody structure of the retted plants by means of mallets and
cross rails fixed to uprights in the water; others break the
stems by hand; while in other cases the stems are handed out of
the water to women who strip off the fibrous layer and preserve
intact the central core or straw to be used ultimately for
thatching. The strips of fibre are all cleaned and rubbed in the
water to remove all the vegetable impurities, and finally the
fibre is dried, usually by hanging it over poles and protecting
it from the direct rays of the sun.</p>
<p>If the water supply is deficient in the vicinity where the
plants are grown, it may be advantageous to convey the fibrous
layers to some other place provided with a better supply of water
for the final washing and drying; imperfect retting and cleaning
are apt to create defects in the fibre, and to cause considerable
trouble or difficulties in subsequent branches of the
industry.</p>
<p>Fig. 3 illustrates photomicrographs of cross sections of a
jute plant. The lower illustration represents approximately one
quarter of a complete cross section. The central part of the stem
or pith is lettered A; the next wide ring B is the woody matter;
the outer covering or cuticle is marked C; while the actual
fibrous layer appears between the parts B and C, and some of the
fibres are indicated by D. The arrows show the corresponding
parts in the three distinct views. The middle illustration shows
an enlarged view of a small part of the lowest view, while the
upper illustration is a further enlarged view of a small section
of the middle view. It will be seen that each group of fibres is
surrounded by vegetable matter.</p>

<h3>FIG. 3 PHOTOMICROGRAPHS OF CROSS SECTIONS OF A JUTE
PLANT</h3>
<p>Another method of stripping the fibrous layer off the stems or
stalks, and one which is practised in certain districts with the
object of preserving the straws, consists in breaking off a small
portion, say one foot, at the top end of the stem; the operative
then grasps the tops by the hand and shakes the plants to and fro
in the water, thus loosening the parts, after which the straws
float out, leaving the fibrous layer free. The straws are
collected for future use, while the fibre is cleaned and washed
in the usual way.</p>
<hr>
<h2><a name="gASSO" href="#ASSOg">CHAPTER IV. ASSORTING AND
BALING JUTE FIBRE</a></h2>
<p>The Indian raw jute trade is conducted under various
conditions. The method of marketing may be of such a nature that
the farmers in some districts may have to make a rough assortment
of the fibre into a number of qualities or grades, and these
grades are well known in the particular areas; on the other hand,
the farmers may prefer to sell the total yield of fibre at an
overhead price per maund. A maund is approximately equal to 8
lbs., and this quantity forms a comparatively small bundle. In
other cases, the fibre is made up into what is known as a "drum";
this is a hand-packed bale of from 1 1/2 to 3 or 3 1/2 maunds; it
is a very convenient size for transit in India.</p>
<p>Practically one half of the total jute crop, of 9 to 10
million bales of 400 lbs. each, is used in India, and the
remaining half is baled for export to the various parts of the
world; a little over one million bales are exported annually to
Great Britain, the bulk of this fibre comes to Dundee.</p>
<p>It is practically impossible for foreign purchasers to see the
material at the assorting stations, but the standardized method
of assorting and grading enables a purchaser to form a very good
idea of the quality of the fibre, and its suitability or
otherwise for special types of yarn and cloth. Thus, a form of
selecting and grading has been established on a basis that
provides a very large amount of jute each year of a quality which
is known as "a first mark." A mark, in general, in reference to
fibre, is simply some symbol, name, letter, monogram or the like,
or a combination of two or more, oft-times with reference to some
colour, to distinguish the origin of the fibre, the baler, or the
merchant.</p>
<p>In normal years there is also a large quantity of fibre of a
better quality than what is known as "first mark," and this
better quality is termed "fine jute"; while there is yet a
further lot, the quality of which is below these good ones. Since
there are hundreds of different marks which are of value only to
those connected directly with the trade, it is unnecessary to
dwell on the subject. The following list, however, shows
quotations of various kinds, and is taken from the Market Report
of the Dundee Advertiser of March, 1920. The price of jute, like
almost everything else, was at this date very high, so in order
to make comparisons with the 1920 and normal prices, we introduce
the prices for the corresponding grade, first marks, for the same
month in the years 1915 onwards.</p>

</pre>
<p>It is necessary to state that the assorting and balings are
generally so uniform that the trade can be conducted quite
satisfactorily with the aid of the usual safeguards under
contract, and guarantees regarding the properties of the
fibre.</p>
<p>After these assorting operations are completed, the jute fibre
is made up into bundles or "bojahs" of 200 lbs. each, and two of
these 200 lb. bundles are subsequently made up into a standard
bale, the weight of which is 400 lbs. This weight includes a
permitted quantity of binding rope, up to 6 lbs. in weight, while
the dimensions in the baling press of the 400 lb. bale are 4'1" X
1'6" X 1' 4".</p>

"FIG. 4 NATIVES CARRYING SMALL BALES OF JUTE FIBRE FROM BOAT TO PRESS HOUSE">
</a><br>
</p>
<h3>FIG. 4 NATIVES CARRYING SMALL BALES OF JUTE FIBRE<br>
FROM BOAT TO PRESS HOUSE</h3>
<p>Large quantities of the smaller and loosely-packed bales are
conveyed from the various places by boats to the baling houses or
press houses as they are termed. These are very large
establishments, and huge staffs of operatives are necessary to
deal rapidly and efficiently with the large number of bales. In
Fig. 4 scores of natives, superintended by a European, are seen
carrying the smaller bales on their heads from the river boat to
the press house. It is, of course, unnecessary to make the solid
400 lb. bales for Indian consumption; this practice is usually
observed only for jute which is to be exported, and all such
bales are weighed and measured at the baling station by a Chamber
of Commerce expert.</p>
<p>Most of the baling presses used in the press houses in the
Calcutta district are made in Liverpool, and are provided with
the most efficient type of pumps and mechanical parts. Fig. 5
illustrates one of these huge presses with a number of natives in
close proximity. Two or three distinct operations are conducted
simultaneously by different groups of operatives, and ingenious
mechanism is essential for the successful prosecution of the
work. Two such presses as that illustrated in Fig. 5 are capable,
under efficient administration, of turning out 130 bales of 400
lbs. each in one hour. The fibre is compressed into comparatively
small bulk by hydraulic pressure equal to 6,000 lbs. per square
inch, and no packed bale must exceed in cubical capacity 11 cubic
feet after it leaves the press; it is usual for freight purposes
to reckon 5 bales or 55 cubic feet per ton. (Now changed to 50
cubic feet.)</p>
<p>The jute bales are loaded either at the wharf or in the river
from barges into large steamers, many of which carry from 30,000
to 46,000 bales in one cargo to the European ports. One vessel
brought 70,000 bales.</p>
<p>As already mentioned, jute is sold under guarantees as to
quality, and all disputes must be settled by arbitration.
Although this is the usual method of sale, it is not uncommon for
quantities of jute to be shipped unsold, and such quantities may
be disposed of on the "Spot." It is a common practice to sell a
number of bales to sample, such number depending generally upon
the extent of the quantity, or "parcel," as it is often called.
The contract forms are very complete, and enable the business to
be conducted to the satisfaction of all concerned in the
trade.</p>

<p>It will be understood that, in the yearly production of such a
large quantity of jute fibre from various districts, and obtained
from plants which have been grown under variable climatic and
agricultural conditions, in some cases the fibre will be of the
finest type procurable, while in other cases it will be of a very
indifferent type and unsuitable for use in the production of the
ordinary classes of yarns and fabrics. On the other hand, it
should be stated that there is such a wide range of goods
manufactured, and additional varieties occasionally introduced,
that it appears possible to utilize all the kinds of fibre in any
year; indeed, it seems as if the available types of fibre each
season create demands for a corresponding type of manufactured
product.</p>
<p>The crops produced will, obviously, vary in amount and value
annually, but a few figures will help the reader to estimate in
some degree the extent of the industry and its development in

<p>A large vessel containing bales of jute is berthed on the
quay-side adjoining the jute sheds in Fig. 6. The bales are
raised quickly from the hold by means of a hydraulic-engine,
scarcely visible in Fig. 6 since it is at the far end of the

sufficiently high, they are guided to the comparatively steep
part of a chute from which they descend to the more horizontal
part as exemplified in Fig. 7. They are then removed by means of
hand-carts as shown, taken into the shed, and piled or stored in
some suitable arrangement with or without the aid of a crane.
Motor and other lorries are then used to convey the bales to the

spinning takes place. It will be understood that the bales are
stored in the spinner's own stores after having been delivered as

required number of bales of each mark can be quickly removed to
the preparing department of the mill.</p>
<p>In the woollen industry, the term "blending" is used to
indicate the mixing of different varieties of material (as well
as different kinds of fibres) for the purpose of obtaining a
mixture suitable for the preparing and spinning of a definite
quality and colour of material. In much the same way, the term
"batching" is used in the jute industry, although it will be seen
shortly that a more extensive use is made of the word. A "batch,"
in its simplest definition, therefore indicates a number of bales
which is suitable for subsequent handling in the Batching
Department. This number may include 5, 6, 7 or more bales of jute
according to the amount of accommodation in the preparing
department.</p>
<p>All the above bales of a batch may be composed of the same
standard quality of jute, although the marks may be different. It
must be remembered that although the marks have a distinct
reference to quality and colour, they actually represent some
particular firm or firms of balers or merchants. At other times,
the batch of 5 to 10 bales may be composed of different qualities
of jute, the number of each kind depending partly upon the
finished price of the yarn, partly upon the colour, and partly
upon the spinning properties of the combination.</p>
<p>It will be understood that the purpose for which the finished
yarn is to be used will determine largely the choice of the bales
for any particular batch. For example, to refer to a simple
differentiation, the yarn which is to be used for the warp
threads in the weaving of cloth must, in nearly every case, have
properties which differ in some respects from the yarn which is
to be used as weft for the same cloth.</p>
<p>On the whole, it will be found advantageous, when the same
grade of jute is required, to select a batch from different
balers' marks so that throughout the various seasons an average
quality may be produced. The same class of yarn is expected at
all times of the year, but it is well known that the properties
of any one mark may vary from time to time owing to the slight
variations in the manipulation of the fibre at the farms, and to
the variations of the weather during the time of growth, and
during the season generally.</p>
<p>A list of the bales for the batch is sent to the batching
department, this list being known as a "batch-ticket." The bales
are, of course, defined by their marks, and those mentioned on
the batch-ticket must be rigidly adhered to for one particular
class of yarn; if there is any chance of one kind running short,
the condition should be notified in time so that a suitable mark
may be selected to take its place without effecting any great
change in the character or quality of the yarn.</p>
<p>When the number and kind of bales have been selected and
removed from the groups or parcels in the store or warehouse,
they are conveyed to the batching department, and placed in a
suitable position near the first machine in the series. It need
hardly be mentioned that since the fibre, during the operation of
baling, is subjected to such a high hydraulic pressure, the bale
presents a very solid and hard appearance, see Fig. 7, for the
various so-called "heads" of fibre have been squeezed together
and forced into a very small bulk. In such a state, the heads are
quite unfitted for the actual batching operation; they require to
be opened out somewhat so that the fibres will be more or less
separated from each other. This operation is termed "opening" and
the process is conducted in what is known as a "bale opener," one
type of which is illustrated in Fig. 8, and made by Messrs.
Urquhart, Lindsay &amp; Co., Ltd., Dundee.</p>
<p>The various bales of the batch are arranged in a suitable
manner near the feed side of the machine, on the left in the
view, so that they can be handled to the best advantage. The
bands or ropes, see Fig. 7, are removed from the bale in order
that the heads or large pieces of jute can be separated. If any
irregularity in the selection of the heads from the different
bales of the batch takes place in this first selection of the
heads of jute, the faulty handling may affect subsequent
operations in such a way that no chance of correcting the defect
can occur; it should be noted at this stage that if there are
slight variations of any kind in the fibres, it is advisable to
make special efforts to obtain a good average mixture; as a
matter of fact, it is wise to insist upon a judicious selection
in every case. The usual variations are--the colour of the fibre,
its strength, and the presence of certain impurities such as
stick, root, bark or specks; if the pieces of jute, which are
affected adversely by any of the above, are carefully mixed with
the otherwise perfect fibre, most of the faults may disappear as
the fibre proceeds on its way through the different machines.</p>

<h3>FIG. 8 BALE OPENER<br>
<i>By permission of Messrs. Urquhart, Lindsay &amp; Co.,
Ltd</i>.</h3>
<p>The layers of heads are often beaten with a heavy sledge
hammer in hand batching, but for machine batching a bale opener
is used, and this operation constitutes the preliminary opening.
As already indicated, the heads of jute are fed into the machine
from the left in Fig. 8, each head being laid on a travelling
feed cloth which carries the heads of jute successively between a
pair of feed rollers from which they are delivered to two pairs
of very deeply-fluted crushing rollers or breakers. The last pair
of deep-fluted rollers is seen clearly on the right in the
figure. These two pairs of heavy rollers crush and bend the
compressed heads of jute and deliver them in a much softer
condition to the delivery sheet on the right. The delivery sheet
is an endless cloth which has a continuous motion, and thus the
softened heads are carried to the extreme right, at which
position they are taken from the sheet by the operatives. The
upper rollers in the machine may rise in their bearings against
the downward pressure of the volute springs on the bearings; this
provision is essential because of the thick and thin places of
the heads.</p>
<p>A different type of bale opener, made by Messrs. Charles
Parker, Sons, &amp; Co., Dundee, and designed from the Butchart
patent is illustrated in Fig. 9. It differs mainly from the
machine illustrated in Fig. 8 in the shape of the crushing or
opening rollers.</p>
<p>It will be seen on referring to the illustration that there
are three crushing rollers, one large central roller on the top
and situated between two lower but smaller rollers. Each roller
has a series of knobs projecting from a number of parallel rings.
The knobs are so arranged that they force themselves into the
hard layers of jute, and, in addition to this action, the heads
of jute have to bend partially round the larger roller as they
are passing between the rollers. This double action naturally
aids in opening up the material, and the machine, which is both
novel and effective, gives excellent results in practice. The
degree of pressure provided for the top roller may be varied to
suit different conditions of heads of jute by the number of
weights which are shown clearly in the highest part of the
machine in the form of two sets of heavy discs.</p>

</p>
<h3>FIG. 9 BALE OPENER<br>
<i>By permission of Messrs. Charles Parker, Sons, &amp;
Co</i>.</h3>
<p>The driving side, the feed cloth, and the delivery cloth in
this machine are placed similarly to the corresponding parts of
the machine illustrated in Fig. 8, a machine which also gives
good results in practice.</p>
<p>In both cases the large heads are delivered in such a
condition that the operatives can split them up into pieces of a
suitable size quite freely.</p>
<p>The men who bring in the bales from the store take up a
position near the end of the delivery cloth; they remove the
heads of jute as the latter approach the end of the table, and
then pass them to the batchers, who split them. The most suitable
size of pieces are 2-1/2 to 3 lbs. for a piece of 7 feet to 8
feet in length, but the size of the pieces is regulated somewhat
by the system of feeding which is to be adopted at the
breaker-card, as well as by the manager's opinion of what will
give the best overall result.</p>
<p>After the heads of jute have been split up into suitable
smaller pieces, they are placed in any convenient position for
the batcher or "striker-up" to deal with. If the reader could
watch the above operation of separating the heads of jute into
suitable sizes, it would perhaps be much easier to understand the
process of unravelling an apparently matted and crossed mass of
fibre. As the loosened head emerges from the bale-opener, Figs. 8
or 9, it is placed over the operative's arm with the ends of the
head hanging, and by a sort of intuition acquired by great
experience, she or he grips the correct amount of fibre between
the fingers, and by a dexterous movement, and a simultaneous
shake of the whole piece, the handful just comes clear of the
bulk and in much less time than it takes to describe the
operation.</p>
<p>As the pieces are thus detached from the bulk, they are laid
on stools or tables, or in stalls or carts, according to the
method by means of which the necessary amount of oil and water is
to be added for the essential process of lubrication; this
lubrication enables the fibre to work freely in the various
machines.</p>
<hr>
<h2><a name="gBATC" href="#BATCg">CHAPTER VI. BATCHING</a></h2>
<p><b>Softening and Softening Machines</b>. Two distinct courses
are followed in the preparation of the jute fibre after it leaves
the bale opener, and before it is carded by the breaker card.
These courses are designated as--</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i6">1. Hand Batching.</p>
<p class="i6">2. Machine Batching.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>In the former process, which is not largely practised, the
pieces of jute are neatly doubled, while imparting a slight
twist, to facilitate subsequent handling, and laid in layers in
large carts which can be wheeled from place to place; if this
method is not convenient, the pieces are doubled similarly and
deposited in large stalls such as those illustrated in Fig.
10.</p>
<p>On the completion of each layer, or sometimes two layers, the
necessary measured amount of oil is evenly sprayed by hand over
the pieces from cans provided with suitable perforated
outlets--usually long tubes. After the oil has been added, water,
from a similar sprayer attached by tubing to a water tap, is
added until the attendant has applied what he or she considers is
the proper quantity. The ratio between a measured amount of oil
and an unmeasured amount of water is thus somewhat varied, and
for this reason the above method is not to be commended. A
conscientious worker can, however, with judgment, introduce
satisfactory proportions which are, of course, supplied by the
person in charge. In Fig. 10, the tank on the right is where the
oil is stored, while the oil can, and the spray-pipe and tube for
water, are shown near the second post or partition on the
right.</p>

</p>
<h3>FIG. 10 HAND-BATCHING DEPARTMENT<br>
WITH UNPREPARED AND PREPARED FIBRE</h3>
<p>The first stall--that next to the oil tank--in Fig. 10 is
filled with the prepared pieces, and the contents are allowed to
remain there for some time, say 24 hours, in order that the
material may be more or less uniformly lubricated or conditioned.
At the end of this time, the pieces are ready to be conveyed to
and fed into the softening machines where the fibres undergo a
further process of bending and crushing.</p>
<p>All softening machines for jute, or softeners as they are
often called, are similar in construction, but the number of
pairs of rollers varies according to circumstances and to the
opinions of managers. Thus, the softener illustrated in Fig. 11,
which, in the form shown, is intended to treat jute from the
above-mentioned stalls, is made with 47, 55, 63 or 71 pairs of
rollers or any other number which, minus 1, is a measure of 8.
The sections are made in 8's. The illustration shows only 31
pairs.</p>
<p>The first pair of rollers--that next to the feed sheet in the
foreground of Fig. 11--is provided with straight flutes as
clearly shown. All the other rollers, however, are provided with
oblique flutes, such flutes making a small angle with the
horizontal. What is often considered as a standard softening
machine contains 63 pairs of fluted rollers besides the usual
feed and delivery rollers. As mentioned above, this number is
varied according to circumstances.</p>
<p>The lubricated pieces of jute are fed on to the feed roller
sheet, and hence undergo a considerable amount of bending in
different ways before they emerge from the delivery rollers at
the other end of the machine.</p>

</p>
<h3>Fig. 11 SOFTENING MACHINE WITHOUT BATCHING APPARATUS</h3>
<p>Machine batching is preferred by many firms because the
application of oil and water, and the proportion of each, are
much more uniform than they are by the above mentioned process of
hand batching. On the other hand, there is no time for
conditioning the fibre because the lubrication and the softening
are proceeding simultaneously, although conditioning may proceed
while the fibre remains in the cart after it has left the
softener.</p>
<p>The mechanical apparatus as made by Messrs. Urquhart, Lindsay
&amp; Co., Ltd., Dundee, for depositing the oil and water on the
pieces or "stricks" of jute is illustrated in Fig. 12. The actual
lubricating equipment is situated on the top of the rectangular
frame in the centre of the illustration. This frame is bolted to
the side frames of the softening machine proper, say that shown
in Fig. 11. Its exact position, with respect to its distance from
the feed, is a matter of choice, but the liquid is often arranged
to fall on to the material at any point between the second and
twelfth rollers.</p>
<p>In Fig. 12 the ends of 13 rollers of the upper set are seen
clearly, and these upper rollers are kept hard in contact with
the stricks or pieces of jute by means of the powerful springs
shown immediately above the roller bearings and partially
enclosed in bell-jars.</p>
<p>Outside the rectangular frame in Fig. 12 are two rods, one
vertical and the other inclined. The straight or vertical rod is
attached by suitable levers and rods to the set-on handles at
each end of the machine and to the valve of the water pipe near
the top of the frame, while the upper end of the inclined or
oblique rod is fulcrumed on a rod projecting from the frame. The
lower or curved end of the oblique rod rests against the boss of
one of the upper rollers.</p>
<a name="FIG._12"></a>

</p>
<h3>FIG. 12 HAND-BATCHING DEPARTMENT<br>
WITH UNPREPARED AND AND PREPARED FIBRE</h3>
<p>The water valve is opened and closed with the starting and
stopping of the machine, but the oblique rod is moved only when
irregular feeding takes place. Thus, the upper rollers rise
slightly against the pressure of the springs when thick stricks
appear; hence, when a thick place passes under the roller which
is in contact with the curved end of the oblique rod, the end
moves slightly clockwise, and thus rotates the fulcrum rod; this
results in an increased quantity of oil being liberated from the
source of supply, and the mechanism is so arranged that the oil
reaches the thick part of the strick. When the above-mentioned
upper roller descends, due to a decrease in the thickness of the
strick, the oblique rod and its fulcrum is moved slightly
counter-clockwise, and less oil is liberated for the thin part of
the strick. It will be understood that all makers of softening
machines supply the automatic lubricating or batching apparatus
when desired.</p>
<p>A view of a softener at work appears in Fig. 13. The bevel
wheels at the end of the rollers are naturally covered as a
protection against accidents. In many machines safety appliances
are fitted at the feed end so that the machine may be
automatically stopped if the operative is in danger. The batching
apparatus for this machine is of a different kind from that
illustrated in Fig. 12; moreover, it is placed nearer the feed
rollers than the twelfth pair. The feed pipes for the oil and the
water are shown coming from a high plane, and the supply is under
the influence of chain gearing as shown on the right near the
large driving belt from the drum on the shafting.</p>
<p>The feed roller in this machine is a spirally fluted one, and
the nature of the flutes is clearly emphasized in the view. The
barrow of jute at the far end of the machine is built up from
stricks which have passed through the machine, and these stricks
are now ready for conditioning, and will be stored in a
convenient position for future treatment.</p>

<h3>Fig. 13 SOFTENING MACHINE WITH BATCHING APPARATUS</h3>
<p>While the jute as assorted and baled for export from India is
graded in such a way that it may be used for certain classes of
yarn without any further selection or treatment, it may be
possible to utilize the material to better advantage by a
judicious selection and treatment after it has undergone the
operation of batching.</p>
<p>What are known as cuttings are often treated by a special
machine known as a "root-opener." The jute cuttings are fed into
the machines and the fibre rubbed between fixed and rotating pins
in order to loosen the matted ends of stricks. Foreign matter
drops through the openings of a grid to the floor, and the fibre
is delivered on to a table, or, if desired, on to the feed sheet
of the softener.</p>
<p>The root ends of stricks are sometimes treated by a special
machine termed a root-comber with the object of loosening the
comparatively hard end of the strick. A snipping machine or a
teazer may also be used for somewhat similar purposes, and for
opening out ropes and similar close textures.</p>
<p>The cuttings may be partially loosened by means of blows from
a heavy iron bar; boiling water is then poured on the fibre, and
then the material is built up with room left for expansion, and
allowed to remain in this condition for a few days. A certain
quantity of this material may then be used along with other marks
of jute to form a batch suitable for the intended yarn.</p>
<p>A very common practice is to cut the hard root ends off by
means of a large stationary knife. At other times, the thin ends
of the stricks are also cut off by the same instrument. These two
parts are severed when it is desired to utilize only the best
part of the strick. The root ends are usually darker in colour
than the remainder, and hence the above process is one of
selection with the object of securing a yarn which will be
uniform in colour and in strength.</p>
<hr>
<h2><a name="gCARD" href="#CARDg">CHAPTER VII. CARDING</a></h2>
<p><b>Breaker and Finisher Cards</b>. After the fibre from the
softening machine has been conditioned for the desired time, it
is ready for one of the most important processes in the cycle of
jute manufacture; this process is termed carding, and is
conducted in two distinct types of machines--</p>
<ul>
<li class="i8">1. The breaker card.</li>
<li class="i8">2. The finisher card.</li>
</ul>
<p>The functions of the two machines are almost identical;
indeed, one might say that the work of carding should be looked
upon as one continuous operation.</p>
<p>The main difference between the two types of machines is in
the method of feeding, and the degree of fineness or setting of
the small tools or pins which perform the work. In both cases the
action on the stricks of jute is equivalent to a combined combing
and splitting movement, and the pins in the various rollers move
relatively to each other so that while the pins of a
slowly-moving roller allow the strick or stricks (because there
are several side by side) to pass slowly and gradually from end
to end, the pins of another but quickly-moving roller perform the
splitting and the combing of the fibre. The pins of the
slowly-moving roller hold, so to speak, the strick, while the
pins of the quickly-moving roller comb out the fibres and split
adhering parts asunder so as to make a comparatively fine
division.</p>
<p>The conditioned stricks from the softening machine are first
arranged in some suitable receptacle and within easy reach of the
operative at the back or feed side of the breaker card. A
receptacle, very similar to that used at the breaker card,
appears near the far end of the softening machine in Fig. 13.</p>
<p>A modern breaker card is illustrated in Fig. 14. The feed or
back of the card is on the extreme right, the delivery or front
of the card on the extreme left, while the gear side of the card
is facing the observer. The protecting cages were removed so that
the wheels would be seen as clearly as possible.</p>
<p>Some of the stricks of fibre are seen distinctly on the feed
side of the figure; they are accommodated, as mentioned, in a
channel-shaped stand on the far side of the inclined feed sheet,
or feed cloth, which leads up to and conveys the stricks into the
grip of the feeding apparatus. This particular type is termed a
"shell" feed because the upper contour of the guiding feed
bracket is shaped somewhat like a shell. There is a gradually
decreasing and suitably-sized gap between the upper part of the
shell and the pins of the feed roller.</p>
<p>The root ends of the pins in this roller lead, and the stricks
of fibre are gripped between the pins and the shell, and
simultaneously carried into the machine where they come into
contact with the points of the pins in the rapidly-revolving
large roller, termed a cylinder. The above-mentioned combing and
splitting action takes place at this point as well as for a
distance of, say, 24 inches to 30 inches below. The fibres which
are separated at this stage are carried a little further round
until they come into contact with the points of the pins in the
above-mentioned slowly-moving roller, termed a "worker," and
while the fibres are moving slowly forward under the restraining
influence of the worker, they are further combed and split. A
portion of the fibres is carried round by the pins of the worker
from which such fibres are removed by the quicker moving pins of
the second roller of the pair, termed a "stripper," and in turn
these fibres are removed from the pins of the stripper by the
much quicker moving pins of the cylinder.</p>
<a name="FIG._14"></a>
<p class="ctr"><a href="images/f4.PNG"><img src="images/f14.PNG"
width="40%" alt="FIG.14 MODERN BREAKER CARD"></a><br>
</p>
<h3>FIG. 14 MODERN BREAKER CARD</h3>
<p>The above operations conducted by the first pair of rollers
(worker and stripper) in conjunction with the cylinder, are
repeated by a second and similar pair of rollers (worker and
stripper), and ultimately the thin sheet of combed and split
fibres comes into contact with the pins of the doffer from which
it is removed by the drawing and pressing rollers. The sheet of
fibres finally emerges from these rollers into the broad and
upper part of the conductor. This conductor, made mostly of tin
and V-shaped, is shown clearly on the left of the machine in Fig.
14. Immediately the thin film or sheet of fibres enters the
conductor, it is caused as a body gradually to contract in width
and, of course, to increase in thickness, and is simultaneously
guided and delivered to the delivery rollers, and from these to
the sliver can, distinctly seen immediately below the delivery
rollers. The sliver is seen emerging from the above rollers and
entering the sliver can.</p>
<p>The fibres in this machine are thus combed, split and drawn
forward relatively to each other, in addition to being arranged
more or less parallel to each other. The technical term "draft"
is used to indicate the operation of causing the fibres to slip
on each other, and in future we shall speak about this
attenuation or drawing out of the fibres by this special term
"draft."</p>
<p>It will be evident that, since the sliver is delivered into
the can at the rate of about 50 yards per minute, this constant
flow will soon provide a sufficient length of sliver to fill a
sliver can, although the latter may hold approximately 20 lbs.
The machine must, of course, deliver its quota to enable
succeeding machines to be kept in practically constant work. As a
matter of fact, the machines are arranged in what are termed
"systems," so that this desirable condition of a constant and
sufficient feed to all may be satisfactorily fulfilled.</p>
<p>The driving or pulley side of the breaker card is very similar
to that shown in Fig. 15 which, however, actually represents the
pulley side of one type of finisher card as made by Messrs.
Douglas Fraser &amp; Sons, Ltd., Arbroath. All finisher cards are
fed by slivers which have been made as explained in connection
with the breaker card, but there are two distinct methods of
feeding the slivers, or rather of arranging the slivers at the
feed side. In both cases, however, the full width of the card is
fed by slivers laid side by side, with, however, a thin guide
plate between each pair, and one at each extreme end.</p>
<p>One very common method of feeding is to place 10 or 12 full
sliver cans--which have been prepared at the breaker card--on the
floor and to the right of the machine illustrated in Fig. 15. The
sliver from each can is then placed into the corresponding sliver
guide, and thus the full width of the machine is occupied. The
slivers are guided by the sliver guides on to an endless cloth or
"feed sheet" which, in turn, conveys them continuously between
the feed rollers. The feed apparatus in such machines is
invariably of the roller type, and sometimes it involves what is
known as a "porcupine" roller. It will be understood that the
feeding of level slivers is a different problem from that which
necessitates the feeding of comparatively uneven stricks.</p>

</p>
<h3>FIG. 15 FINISHER CARD WITH DRAWING-HEAD<br>
<i>By permission of Messrs. Douglas Fraser &amp;Sons,
Ltd.</i></h3>
<p>The slivers travel horizontally with the feed-sheet and enter
the machine at a height of about 4 feet from the floor. They thus
form, as it were, a sheet of fibrous material at the entrance,
and this sheet of fibres comes in contact with the pins of the
various pairs of rollers, the cylinder, and the doffer, in much
the same way as already described in connection with the breaker
card. There are, however, more pairs of rollers in the finisher
card than there are in the breaker card, for while the latter is
provided with two pairs of rollers, the former may be arranged
with 3, 4, 5 or even 6 pairs of rollers (6 workers and 6
strippers). The number of pairs of rollers depends upon the
degree of work required, and upon the opinions of the various
managers.</p>
<p>There are two distinct types of finisher cards, viz--</p>
<ul>
<li class="i8">1. Half-circular finisher cards.</li>
<li class="i8">2. Full-circular finisher cards.</li>
</ul>
<p>The machine illustrated in Fig. 15 is of the latter type, and
such machines are so-called because the various pairs of rollers
are so disposed around the cylinder that they occupy almost a
complete circle, and the fibre under treatment must move from
pair to pair to undergo the combing and splitting action before
coming into contact with the doffer. There are five pairs of
rollers in the machine in Fig. 15, and all the rollers are
securely boxed in, and the wheels fenced. The arrangement of the
wheels on the gear side is very similar to that shown in
connection with the breaker card in Fig. 14, and therefore
requires no further mention. Outside the boxing comes the covers,
shown clearly at the back of the machine in Fig. 15, and adapted
to be easily and quickly opened when it is desired to examine the
rollers and other parts.</p>
<p>The slivers, after having passed amongst the pins of the
various rollers, and been subjected to the required degree of
draft, are ultimately doffed as a thin film of fibres from the
pins of the cylinder and pass between the drawing rollers to the
conductor. The conductor of a finisher card is made in two
widths, so that half the width of the film enters one section and
the other half enters the other section. These two parallel
sheets, split from one common sheet, traverse the two conductors
and are ultimately delivered as two slivers about 6 inches above
the point or plane in which the 10 or 12 slivers entered, and on
to what is termed a "sliver plate." The two slivers are then
guided by horns projecting from the upper surface of the sliver
plate, made to travel at right angles to the direction of
delivery from the mouths of the conductors, and then united to
pass as a single sliver between a pair of delivery rollers on the
left of the feed and delivery side and finally into a sliver
can.</p>
<p>In special types of finishing cards, an extra piece of
mechanism--termed a draw-head--is employed. The machine
illustrated in Fig. 15 is provided with this extra mechanism
which is supported by the small supplementary frame on the
extreme right. This special mechanism is termed a "Patent Push
Bar Drawing Head," and the function which it performs will be
described shortly; in the meantime it is sufficient to say that
it is used only when the slivers from the finisher card require
extra or special treatment. A very desirable condition in
connection with the combination of a finisher card and a
draw-head is that the two distinct parts should work in unison.
In the machine under consideration, the feed and delivery rollers
of the card stop simultaneously with the stoppage of the
draw-head mechanism.</p>
<p>One of the chief aims in spinning is that of producing a
uniform thread; uniform not only in section, but in all other
respects. A so-called level thread refers, in general, to a
uniform diameter, but there are other equally, if not more,
important phases connected with the full sense of the word
uniform.</p>
<p>It has already been stated that in the batching department
various qualities of jute are mixed as judiciously as possible in
order to obtain a satisfactory mixture. Fibres of different
grades and marks vary in strength, colour, cleanness, diameter,
length and suppleness; it is of the utmost importance that these
fibres of diverse qualities should be distributed as early as
possible in the process so as to facilitate the subsequent
operations.</p>

<p>However skilfully the work of mixing the stricks is performed
in the batching department, the degree of uniformity leaves
something to be desired; further improvement is still desirable
and indeed necessary. It need hardly be said, however, that the
extent of the improvement, and the general final result, are
influenced greatly by the care which is exercised in the
preliminary processes.</p>
<p>The very fact of uniting 10 or 12 slivers at the feed of the
finisher card mixes 10 or 12 distinct lengths into another new
length, and, in addition, separates in some measure the fibres of
each individual sliver. It must not be taken for granted that the
new length of sliver is identical with each of the individual
lengths and ten or twelve times as bulky. A process of drafting
takes place in the finisher card, so that the fibres which
compose the combined 10 or 12 slivers shall be drawn out to a
draft of 8 to 16 or even more; this means that for every yard of
the group of slivers which passes into the machine there is drawn
out a length of 8 to 16 yards or whatever the draft happens to
be. The resulting sliver will therefore be approximately
two-thirds the bulk of each of the original individual slivers.
The actual ratio between them will obviously depend upon the
actual draft which is imparted to the material by the relative
velocities of the feed and delivery rollers.</p>
<p>It is only natural to expect that a certain amount of the
fibrous material will escape from the rollers; this forms what is
known as card waste. And in all subsequent machines there is
produced, in spite of all care, a percentage of the amount fed
into the machine which is not delivered as perfect material. All
this waste from various sources, e.g. thread waste, rove waste,
card waste, ropes, dust-shaker waste, etc., is ultimately
utilized to produce sliver for heavy sacking weft.</p>
<p>The dust-shaker, as its name implies, separates the dust from
the valuable fibrous material, and finally all the waste products
are passed through a waste teazer such as that made by Messrs. J.
F. Low &amp; Co., Ltd., Monifieth, and illustrated in Fig. 16.
The resulting mass is then re-carded, perhaps along with other
more valuable material, and made into a sliver which is used, as
stated above, in the production of a cheap and comparatively
thick weft such as that used for sacking.</p>
<hr>
<h2><a name="gDRAW" href="#DRAWg">CHAPTER VIII. DRAWING AND
DRAWING FRAMES</a></h2>
<p>The operations of combing and splitting as performed in both
the breaker and finisher card are obviously due to the circular
movement of the pins since all these (with the single exception
of those in the draw-head mechanism of certain finisher cards)
are carried on the peripheries of rotating rollers. In the
draw-head mechanism, the pins move, while in contact with the
fibres, in a rectilinear or straight path. In the machines which
fall to be discussed in this chapter, viz., the "drawing frames,"
the action of the pins on the slivers from the finisher card is
also in a straight path; as a matter of fact, the draw-head of a
finisher card is really a small drawing frame, as its name
implies. Moreover, each row or rather double row, of pins is
carried separately by what is termed a "faller." The faller as a
whole consists of three parts:</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i6">1. A long iron or steel rod with provision for
being</p>
<p class="i10">moved in a closed circuit.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i6">2. Pour or six brass plates, termed "gills" or</p>
<p class="i10">"stocks," fixed to the rod.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i6">3. A series of short pins (one row sometimes
about</p>
<p class="i10">1/8 in. shorter than the second row), termed gill
or</p>
<p class="i10">hackle pins, and set perpendicularly in the
above</p>
<p class="i10">gills.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The numbers of fallers used is determined partly by the
particular method of operating the fallers, but mostly by the
length of the fibre. The gill pins in the fallers are used to
restrain the movements of the fibres between two important pairs
of rollers. There are actually about four sets of rollers from
front to back of a drawing frame; one set of three rollers
constitute the "retaining" rollers; then comes the drawing roller
and its large pressing roller; immediately after this pair is the
"slicking" rollers, and the last pair is the delivery rollers.
The delivery rollers of one type of drawing frame, called the
"push-bar" drawing frame, and made by Messsrs. Douglas Fraser
&amp; Sons, Ltd., Arbroath, are seen distinctly in Fig. 17, and
the can or cans into which the slivers are ultimately delivered
are placed immediately below one or more sections of these
rollers and in the foreground of the illustration. The large
pressing rollers, which are in contact with the drawing roller,
occupy the highest position in the machine and near the centre of
same. Between these rollers and the retaining rollers are
situated the above-mentioned fallers with their complements of
gill pins, forming, so to speak, a field of pins.</p>
<p>Each sliver, and there maybe from four to eight or more in a
set, is led from its sliver can at the far side of the machine to
the sliver guide and between the retaining rollers. Immediately
the slivers leave the retaining rollers they are penetrated by
the gill pins of a faller which is rising from the lower part of
its circuit to the upper and active position. Each short length
of slivers is penetrated by the pins of a rising faller, these
coming up successively as the preceding one moves along at
approximately the same surface speed as that of the retaining
rollers. The sheet of pins and their fallers are thus
continuously moving towards the drawing rollers and supporting
the slivers at the same time. As each faller in succession
approaches close to the drawing rollers, it is made to descend so
that the pins may leave the fibres, and from this point the
faller moves backwards towards the retaining roller until it
reaches the other end ready to rise again in contact with the
fibres and to repeat the cycle as just described. It will thus be
seen that the upper set of fallers occupy the full stretch
between the retaining rollers and the drawing rollers, but there
is always one faller leaving the upper set at the front and
another joining the set at the back.</p>
<a name="FIG._17"></a>
<p class="ctr"><a href="images/f17.PNG"><img src="images/f17.PNG"
width="40%" alt="Fig. 17 Push-bar drawing frame"></a><br>
</p>
<h3>Fig. 17 PUSH-BAR DRAWING FRAME</h3>
<p>The actual distance between the retaining rollers and the
drawing rollers is determined by the length of the fibre, and
must in all cases be a little greater than the longest fibre.
This condition is necessary because the surface speed of the
drawing roller is much greater than that of the retaining
rollers; indeed, the difference between the surface speeds of the
two pairs of rollers is the actual draft.</p>
<p>Between the retaining and drawing rollers the slivers are
embedded in the gill pins of the fallers, and these move forward,
as mentioned, to support the stretch of slivers and to carry the
latter to the nip of the drawing rollers. Immediately the forward
ends of the fibres are nipped between the quickly-moving drawing
rollers, the fibres affected slide on those which have not yet
reached the drawing rollers, and, incidentally, help to
parallelize the fibres. It will be clear that if any fibre
happened to be in the grip of the two pairs of rollers having
different surface speeds, such fibre would be snapped. It is to
avoid this rupture of fibres that the distance between the two
sets of rollers is greater than the longest fibres under
treatment. The technical word for this distance is "reach."</p>
<p>On emerging from the drawing rollers, the combed slivers pass
between slicking rollers, and then approach the sliver plate
which bridges the gap between the slicking rollers and the
delivery rollers, and by means of which plate two or more
individual slivers are diverted at right angles, first to join
each other, and then again diverted at right angles to join
another sliver which passes straight from the drawing rollers and
over the sliver plate to the guide of the delivery rollers. It
will thus be seen that a number of slivers, each having been
drawn out according to the degree of draft, are ultimately joined
to pass through a common sliver guide or conductor to the nip of
the delivery rollers, and thence into a sliver can.</p>
<p>The push-bar drawing illustrated in Fig. 17, or some other of
the same type, is often used as the first drawing frame in a set.
With the exception of the driving pulleys, all the gear wheels
are at the far end of the frame, and totally enclosed in
dust-proof casing. The set-on handles, for moving the belt from
the loose pulley to the fast pulley, or <i>vice versa</i>, are
conveniently situated, as shown, and in a place which is
calculated to offer the least obstruction to the operative. The
machines are made with what are known as "two heads" or "three
heads." It will be seen from the large pressing rollers that
there are two pairs; hence the machine is a "two-head" drawing
frame.</p>
<p>The slivers from the first drawing frame are now subjected to
a further process of doubling and drafting in a very similar
machine termed the second drawing frame. The pins in the gills
for this frame are rather finer and more closely set than those
in the first drawing frame, but otherwise the active parts of the
machines, and the operations conducted therein, are practically
identical, and therefore need no further description. It should
be mentioned, however, that there are different types of drawing
frames, and their designation is invariably due to the particular
manner in which the fallers are operated while traversing the
closed circuit. The names of other drawing frames appear
below.</p>
<ul>
<li class="i2">Spiral or screw gill;</li>
<li class="i2">Open link chain;</li>
<li class="i2">Rotary;</li>
<li class="i2">Ring Carrier</li>
<li class="i2">Circular.</li>
</ul>
<p>For the preparation of slivers for some classes of yarn it is
considered desirable to extend the drawing and doubling operation
in a third drawing frame; as a rule, however, two frames are
considered sufficient for most classes of ordinary yarn.</p>
<hr>
<h2><a name="gTHER" href="#THERg">CHAPTER IX. THE ROVING
FRAME</a></h2>
<p>The process of doubling ends with the last drawing frame, but
there still remains a process by means of which the drafting of
the slivers and the parallelization of the fibres are continued.
And, in addition to these important functions, two other equally
important operations are conducted simultaneously, viz., that of
imparting to the drawn out sliver a slight twist to form what is
known as a "rove" or roving, and that of winding the rove on to a
large rove bobbin ready for the actual spinning frame.</p>
<p>The machine in which this multiple process is performed is
termed a "roving frame." Such machines are made in various sizes,
and with different types of faller mechanism, but each machine is
provided for the manipulation of two rows of bobbins, and, of
course, with two rows of spindles and flyers. These two rows of
spindles, flyers, and rove bobbin supports are shown clearly in
Fig. 18, which represents a spiral roving frame made by Messrs.
Douglas Fraser &amp; Sons, Ltd., Arbroath.</p>
<p>Each circular bobbin support is provided with pins rising from
the upper face of the disc, and these pins serve to enter holes
in the flange of the bobbin and thus to drive the bobbin. The
discs or bobbin supports are situated in holes in the "lifter
rail" or "builder rail" or simply the "builder"; the vertical
spindles pass through the centre of the discs, each spindle being
provided with a "flyer," and finally a number of plates rest upon
the tops of the spindles.</p>

</p>
<h3>FIG. 18 ROVING FRAME<br>
<i>By Permission of Messrs. Douglas Fraser &amp; Sons,
Ltd</i></h3>
<p>A roving machine at work is shown in Fig. 19, and it will be
seen that the twisted sliver or rove on emerging from the drawing
rollers passes obliquely to the top of the spindle, through a
guide eye, then between the channel-shaped bend at the upper part
of the flyer, round the flyer arm, through an eye at the extreme
end of either of the flyer arms, and finally on to the bobbin.
Each bobbin has its own sliver can (occasionally two), and the
sliver passes from this can between the sides of the sliver
guide, between the retaining rollers, then amongst the gill pins
of the fallers and between the drawing (also the delivery)
rollers. Here the sliver terminates because the rotary action of
the flyer imparts a little twist and causes the material to
assume a somewhat circular sectional form. From this point, the
path followed to the bobbin is that described above.</p>
<p>As in all the preceding machines, the delivery speed of the
sliver is constant and is represented by the surface speed of the
periphery of the delivery rollers, this speed approximates to
about 20 yards per minute. The spindles and their flyers are also
driven at a constant speed, because in all cases we have--</p>
<ul>
<li class="i2">spindle speed = delivery x twist.</li>
</ul>
<p>There is thus a constant length of yarn to be wound on the
rove bobbin per minute, and the speed of the bobbin, which is
driven independently of the spindle and flyer, is constant for
any one series of rove coils on the bobbin. The speed of the
bobbin differs, however, for each complete layer of rove, simply
because the effective diameter of the material on the bobbin
changes with the beginning of each new layer.</p>
<p>The eyes of the flyers always rotate in the same horizontal
plane, and hence the rove always passes to the bobbins at the
same height from any fixed point. The bobbins, however, are
raised gradually by the builder during the formation of each
layer from the top of the bobbin to the bottom, and lowered
gradually by the builder during the formation of each layer from
bottom to top. In other words, the travel of the builder is
represented by the distance between the inner faces of the
flanges of the rove bobbin.</p>

</p>
<h3>FIG. 19 ROVING FRAME<br>
 FAIRBAIRN'S ROVING FRAME IN WORK</h3>
<p>Since every complete layer of rove is wound on the bobbin in
virtue of the joint action of the spindle and flyer, the rotating
bobbin, and the builder, each complete traverse of the latter
increases the combined diameter of the rove and bobbin shaft by
two diameters of the rove. It is therefore necessary to impart an
intermittent and variable speed to the bobbin. The mechanism by
means of which this desirable and necessary speed is given to the
bobbin constitutes one of the most elegant groups of mechanical
parts which obtains in textile machinery. Some idea of the
intricacy of the mechanism, as well as its value and importance
to the industry, may be gathered from the fact that a
considerable number of textile and mechanical experts struggled
with the problem for years; indeed 50 years elapsed before an
efficient and suitable group of mechanical parts was evolved for
performing the function.</p>
<p>The above group of mechanical parts is known as "the
differential motion," and the difficulties in constructing its
suitable gearing arose from the fact that the speed of the rove
passing on to the various diameters must be maintained
throughout, and must coincide with the delivery of yarn from the
rollers, so that the attenuated but slightly twisted sliver can
be wound on to the bobbin without strain or stretch. The varying
motion is regulated and obtained by a drive, either from friction
plates or from cones, and the whole gear is interesting,
instructive--and sometimes bewildering--two distinct motions, a
constant one and a variable one, are conveyed to the bobbins from
the driving shaft of the machine.</p>
<p>The machine illustrated in Fig. 18 is of special design, and
the whole train of gear, with the exception of a small train of
wheels to the retaining roller, is placed at the pulley end--that
nearest the observer. The gear wheels are, as shown, efficiently
guarded, and provision is made to start or stop the machine from
any position on both sides. The machine is adapted for building
10 in. X 5 in. bobbins, i.e. 10 in. between the flanges and 5 in.
outside diameter, and provided with either 56 or 64 spindles, the
illustration showing part of a machine and approximately 48
spindles.</p>
<p>The machines for rove (roving frames) are designated by the
size of the bobbin upon which the rove is wound, e.g. 10 in. x 5
in. frame, and so on; this means that the flanges of the bobbin
are 10 in. apart and 5 in. in diameter, and hence the traverse of
the builder would be 10 in. The 10 in. x 5 in. bobbin is the
standard size for the ordinary run of yarns, but 9 in. x 4-1/2
in. bobbins are used for the roves from which finer yarns are
spun. When the finished yarn appears in the form of rove (often
termed spinning direct), as is the case for heavier sizes or
thick yarns, 8 in. x 4 in. bobbins are largely used.</p>
<p>Provision is made on each roving frame for changing the size
of rove so as to accommodate it for the subsequent process of
spinning and according to the count of the required yarn; the
parts involved in these changes are those which affect the draft
gearing, the twist gearing, and the builder gearing in
conjunction with the automatic index wheel which acts on the
whole of the regulating motion.</p>
<hr>
<h2><a name="gSPIN" href="#SPINg">CHAPTER X. SPINNING</a></h2>
<p>The final machine used in the conversion of rove to the size
of yarn required is termed the spinning frame. The actual process
of spinning is performed in this machine, and, although the whole
routine of the conversion of fibre into yarn often goes under the
name of spinning, it is obvious that a considerable number of
processes are involved, and an immense amount of work has to be
done before the actual process of spinning is attempted. The
nomenclature is due to custom dating back to prehistoric times
when the conversion of fibre to yarn was conducted by much
simpler apparatus than it is at present; the established name to
denote this conversion of fibre to yarn now refers only to one of
a large number of important processes, each one of which is as
important and necessary as the actual operation of spinning.</p>
<p>A photographical reproduction of a large spinning flat in one
of the Indian jute mills appears in Fig. 20, showing particularly
the wide "pass" between two long rows of spinning frames, and the
method adopted of driving all the frames from a long line shaft.
Spinning frames are usually double-sided, and each side may
contain any practicable number of spindles; 64 to 80 spindles per
side are common numbers.</p>
<a name="FIG._20"></a>

</p>
<h3>FIG 20. AN INDIAN SPINNING FLAT</h3>
<p>The rove bobbins, several of which are clearly seen in Fig.
20, are brought from the roving frame and placed on the iron pegs
of a creel (often called a hake) near the top of the spinning
frame-actually above all moving parts of the machine. Each rove
bobbin is free to rotate on its own peg as the rove from it is
drawn downwards by the retaining rollers. The final drafting of
the material takes place in this frame, and a considerable amount
of twist is imparted to the drawn out material; the latter, now
in the desired form and size of yarn, is wound simultaneously on
to a suitable size and form of spinning bobbin.</p>
<p>When the rove emerges from the retaining rollers it is passed
over a "breast-plate," and then is entered into the wide part of
the conductor; it then leaves by the narrow part of the conductor
by means of which part the rove is guided to the nip of the
drawing rollers, The rove is, of course, drafted or drawn out
between the retaining and drawing rollers according to the draft
required, and the fibrous material, now in thread size is placed
in a slot of the "thread-plate," then round the top of the flyer,
round one of the arms of the flyer, through the eye or palm at
the end of the flyer arm and on to the spinning bobbin. The
latter is raised and lowered as in the roving frame by a builder
motion, so that the yarn may be distributed over the full range
between the ends or flanges.</p>
<p>Each spindle is driven separately by means of a tape or band
which passes partially round the driving cylinder and the driven
whorl of the spindle, and a constant relation obtains between the
delivery of the yarn and the speed of the spindle during the
operation of spinning any fixed count or type of yarn. In this
connection, the parts resemble those in the roving frame, but
from this point the functions of the two frames differ. The yarn
has certainly to be wound upon the bobbin and at the same rate as
it is delivered from the drawing or delivery rollers, but in the
spinning frame the bobbin, which rotates on the spindle, is not
driven positively, as in the roving frame, by wheel gearing; each
spinning bobbin is actually driven by the yarn being pulled round
by the arm of the flyer and just sufficient resistance is offered
by the pressure or tension of the "temper band" and weight. The
temper band is simply a piece of leather or hemp twine to which
is attached a weight, and the other end of the leather or twine
is attached to the builder rail.</p>

</p>
<h3>FIG. 21 A LINE OF SPINNING FRAMES</h3>
<p>The front part of the builder rail is provided with grooves
into one of which the temper-band is placed so that the band
itself is in contact with a groove near the base of the bobbin
flange. A varying amount of resistance or tension on the bobbin
is required in virtue of the varying size of the partially-filled
bobbin, and this is obtained by placing the temper-band
successively in different groves in the builder so that it will
embrace a gradually increasing arc of the spinning bobbin, and
thus impart a heavier drag or tension.</p>
<p>The spinning frames in Fig. 20 are arranged with the ends of
the frame parallel to the pass, whereas the end frames in Fig. 21
are at right angles to the pass, and hence an excellent view of
the chief parts is presented. The full rove bobbins are seen
distinctly on the pegs of the creel in the upper part of the
figure, and the rove yarns from these bobbins pass downwards, as
already described, until they ultimately enter the eyes of the
flyer arms to be directed to and wound upon the spinning bobbins.
The flyers--at one time termed throstles--are clearly visible a
little above the row of temper weights. The chief parts for
raising the builder--cam lever, adjustable rod, chain and
wheel--are illustrated at the end of the frame nearest the
observer.</p>
<hr>
<h2><a name="gTWIS" href="#TWISg">CHAPTER XI. TWISTING AND
REELING</a></h2>
<p>In regard to cloth manufacture, most yarns are utilized in the
form they leave the spinning frame, that is, as single yarns. On
the other hand, for certain branches of the trade, weaving
included, it is necessary to take two, three, or more of these
single yarns and to combine them by a process technically termed
twisting, and sometimes "doubling" when two single yarns only are
combined.</p>
<p>Although the commonest method, so far as weaving requirements
go, is to twist two single yarns together to make a compound
yarn, it is not uncommon to combine a much higher number, indeed,
sixteen or more single yarns are often united for special
purposes, but, when this number is exceeded, the operation comes
under the heading of twines, ropes and the like. The twist or
twine thus formed will have the number of yarns regulated by the
levelness and strength required for the finished product. The
same operation is conducted in the making of strands for cordage,
but when a number of these twines are laid-up or twisted
together, the name cord or rope is used to distinguish
them.[1]</p>
<p>[Footnote 1: See <i>Cordage and Cordage Hemp and Fibres</i>,
by T. Woodhouse and P. Kilgour.]</p>
<p>When two or three threads are united by twisting, the
operation can be conducted in a twisting frame which differs
little from a ordinary spinning frame, and hence need not be
described. There may be, however, appliances embodying some
system of automatic stop motion to bring the individual spindles
to rest if one thread out of any group which are being combined
happens to break. When several threads have to be twisted
together, special types of twisting frames are employed; these
special machines are termed "tube twisters," and the individual
threads pass through holes suitably placed in a plate or disc
before they reach the tube.</p>
<p>More or less elaborate methods of combining yarns are
occasionally adopted, but the reader is advised to consult the
above-mentioned work on Cordage and similar literature for
detailed information.</p>
<p>When the yarn leaves the spinning frame, or the twisting
frame, it is made up according to requirements, and the general
operations which follow spinning and twisting are,--reeling,
cop-winding, roll or spool winding, mill warping or link warping.
The type or class of yarn, the purpose for which the yarn is to
be used, or the equipment of the manufacturer, determines which
of these methods should be used previous to despatching the
yarn.</p>
<p><b>Reeling</b>. Reeling is a comparatively simple operation,
consisting solely of winding the yarns from the spinning or
twisting bobbins on to a wide swift or reel of a suitable width
and of a fixed diameter, or rather circumference. Indeed, the
circumference of the reel was fixed by an Act of Convention of
Estates, dating as far back as 1665 and as under:</p>
<p><em>"That no linen yarn be exported under the pain of
confiscation, half to the King and half to the
attacher."</em></p>
<p><em>"That linen yarn be sold by weight and that no reel be
shorter than <b>ten quarters</b>."</em></p>
<p>The same size of reel has been adopted for all jute yarns. All
such yarns which are to be dyed, bleached, or otherwise treated
must be reeled in order that the liquor may easily penetrate the
threads which are obviously in a loose state. There are systems
of dyeing and bleaching yarns in cop, roll or beam form, but
these are not employed much in the jute industry. Large
quantities of jute yarns intended for export are reeled, partly
because bundles form suitable bales for transport, and partly
because of the varied operations and sizes of apparatus which
obtain in foreign countries.</p>

    12 cuts     or   3,600   yards    = 1 standard hank
    48 cuts     or  14,400   yards    = 1 spyndle
</pre>
<p>Since jute yarns are comparatively thick, it is only the very
finest yarns which contain 12 cuts per hank. The bulk of the yarn
is made up into 6-cut hanks. If the yarn should be extra thick,
even 6 cuts are too many to be combined, and one finds groups of
4 cuts, 3 cuts, 2 cuts, and even 1 cut. A convenient name for any
group less than 12 cuts is a "mill-hank," because the number used
is simply one of convenience to enable the mill-hank to be
satisfactorily placed on the swift in the winding frame.</p>
<p>The reeling operation is useful in that it enables one to
measure the length of the yarn; indeed, the operation of reeling,
or forming the yarn into cuts and hanks, has always been used as
the method of designating the count, grist or number of the yarn.
We have already seen that the count of jute yarn is determined by
the weight in lbs. of one spyndle (14,400 yds.).</p>
<p>For 8 lb. per spyndle yarn, and for other yarns of about the
same count, it is usual to have provision for 24 spinning bobbins
on the reel. As the reel rotates, the yarn from these 24 bobbins
is wound round, say,</p>
<p>6 in. apart, and when the reel has made 120 revolutions, or
120 threads at each place from each bobbin, there will be 24
separate cuts of yarn on the reel. When 120 threads have been
reeled as mentioned, a bell rings to warn the attendant that the
cuts are complete; the reel is then stopped, and a "lease-band"
is tied round each group of 120 threads.</p>
<p>A guide rod moves the thread guide laterally and slowly as the
reeling operation is proceeding so that each thread or round may
be in close proximity to its neighbour without riding on it, and
this movement of the thread extends to approximately 6 in., to
accommodate the 6 cuts which are to form the mill-hank.</p>
<p>Each time the reel has made 120 revolutions and the bell
rings, the reeler ties up the several cuts in the width, so that
when the mill-hank is complete, each individual cut will be
distinct. In some case, the two threads of the lease-band instead
of being tied, are simply crossed and recrossed at each cut,
without of course breaking the yarn which is being reeled,
although effectively separating the cuts. At the end of the
operation (when the quantity of cuts for the mill-hank has been
reeled) the ends of the lease-band are tied.</p>
<p>The object of the lease-band is for facilitating the operation
of winding, and for enabling the length to be checked with
approximate correctness.</p>
<p>When the reel has been filled with, say, twenty-four 6-cut
hanks, there will evidently be 3 spyndles of yarn on the reel.
The 24 mill-hanks are then slipped off the end of the reel, and
the hanks taken to the bundling stool or frame. Here they, along
with others of the same count, are made up into bundles which
weigh from 54 lb. to 60 lb. according to the count of the yarn.
Each bundle contains a number of complete hanks, and it is
unusual to split a hank for the purpose of maintaining an
absolutely standard weight bundle. Indeed, the bundles contain an
even number of hanks, so that while there would be exactly 56 lb.
per bundle of 7 lb. yarn, or 8 lb. yarn, there would be 60 lb in
a bundle of 7-1/2 lb. yarn, and 54 lb. in a bundle of 9 lb.
yarn.</p>
<p>The chief point in reeling is to ensure that the correct
number of threads is in each cut, i.e. to obtain a "correct
tell"; this ideal condition may be impracticable in actual work,
but it is wise to approach it as closely as possible. Careless
workers allow the reel to run on after one or more spinning
bobbins are empty, and this yields what is known as "short tell."
It is not uncommon to introduce a bell wheel with, say, 123 or
124 teeth, instead of the nominal 120 teeth, to compensate for
this defect in reeling.</p>

<h2><a name="gWIND" href="#WINDg">CHAPTER XII. WINDING: ROLLS AND
COPS</a></h2>
<p>The actual spinning and twisting operations being thus
completed, the yarns are ready to be combined either for more
elaborate types of twist, or for the processes of cloth
manufacture. In its simplest definition, a fabric consists of two
series of threads interlaced in such way as to form a more or
less solid and compact structure. The two series of threads which
are interlaced receive the technical terms of warp and weft--in
poetical language, warp and woof. The threads which form the
length of the cloth constitute the warp, while the transverse
threads are the weft.</p>
<p>The warp threads have ultimately to be wound or "beamed" on to
a large roller, termed a weaver's beam, while the weft yarn has
to be prepared in suitable shape for the shuttle. These two
distinct conditions necessitate two general types of winding:</p>
<p>(<i>a</i>) Spool winding or bobbin winding for the warp
yarns.</p>
<p>(<i>b</i>) Cop winding or pirn winding for the weft yarns.</p>
<p>For the jute trade, the bulk of the warp yarn is wound from
the spinning bobbin on to large rolls or spools which contain
from 7 to 8 lb. of yarn; the weft is wound from the spinning
bobbin into cops which weigh approximately 4 to 8 ounces.</p>
<p>Originally all jute yarns for warp were wound on to flanged
bobbins very similar to, but larger than, those which are at
present used for the linen trade. The advent of the roll-winding
machine marked a great advance in the method of winding warp
yarns as compared with the bobbin winding method; indeed, in the
jute trade, the latter are used only for winding from hank those
yarns which have been bleached, dyed or similarly treated. Fig.
22 illustrates one of the modern bobbin winding machines for jute
made by Messrs. Charles Parker, Sons &amp; Co., Dundee. The
finished product is illustrated by two full bobbins on the stand
and close to a single empty bobbin. There are also two full
bobbins in the winding position, and several hanks of yarn on the
swifts. Each bobbin is driven by means of two discs, and since
the drive is by surface contact between the discs and the bobbin,
an almost constant speed is imparted to the yarn throughout the
process. An automatic stop motion is provided for each bobbin;
this apparatus lifts the bobbin clear of the discs when the
bobbin is filled as exemplified in the illustration.</p>
<p>The distance between the flanges of the bobbin is, obviously,
a fixed one in any one machine, and the diameter over the yarn is
limited. On the other hand, rolls may be made of varying widths
and any suitable diameter. And while a bobbin holds about 2 lb.
of yarn, a common size of roll weighs, as already stated, from 7
to 8 lb. Such a roll measures, about 9 in. long and 8 in.
diameter; hence for 8 lb. yarn, the roll capacity is 14,400
yards.</p>
<p>Rolls very much larger than the above are made on special
machines adopted to wind about six rolls as shown in Fig. 23. It
is built specially for winding heavy or thick yarns into rolls of
15 in. diameter and 14 in. length, and this particular machine is
used mostly by rope makers and carpet manufacturers. One roll
only is shown in the illustration, and it is winding the material
from a 10 in. x 5 in. rove bobbin. The rove is drawn forward by
surface or frictional contact between the roll itself and a
rapidly rotating drum. The yarn guide is moved rapidly from side
to side by means of the grooved cam on the left, the upright
lever fulcrumed near the floor, and the horizontal rod which
passes in front of the rolls and upon which are fixed the actual
yarn guides. This rapid traverse, combined with the rotation of
the rolls, enables the yarn to be securely built upon a paper or
wooden tube; no flanges are required, and hence the initial cost
as well as the upkeep of the foundations for rolls is much below
that for bobbins.</p>

</p>
<h3>FIG. 22 BOBBIN WINDING MACHINE WITH HANKS</h3>
<p>Precisely the same principles are adopted for winding the
ordinary 9 in. x 8 in. or 8 in. x 7 in. rolls for the warping and
dressing departments. These rolls are made direct from the yarn
on spinning bobbins, but the machines are usually double-sided,
each side having two tiers; a common number of spools for one
machine is 80.</p>
<p>The double tier on each side is practicable because of the
small space required for the spinning bobbins. When, however,
rolls are wound from hank, as is illustrated in Fig. 24, and as
practised in several foreign countries even for grey yarn, one
row only at each side is possible. Both types are made by each
machine maker, the one illustrated in Fig. 24 being the product
of Messrs. Charles Parker, Sons &amp; Co., Dundee.</p>
<p>In all cases, the yarns are built upon tubes as mentioned, the
wooden ones weighing only a few ounces and being practically
indestructible, besides being very convenient for transit; indeed
it looks highly probable that the use of these articles will
still further reduce the amount of yarn exported in bundle
form.</p>

sizes of rolls, can be run at a high speed, and possesses

<p>Weft Winding. A few firms wind jute weft yarn from the
spinning bobbins on to pirns (wooden centres). The great majority
of manufacturers, however, use cops for the loom shuttles. The
cops are almost invariably wound direct from the spinning
bobbins, the exception being coloured yarn which is wound from
hank. There are different types of machines used for cop winding,
but in every case the yarn is wound upon a bare spindle, and the
yarn guide has a rapid traverse in order to obtain the well-known
cross-wind so necessary for making a stable cop. The disposition
of the cops in the winding operation is vertical, but while in
some machines the tapered nose of the cop is in the high position
and the spinning bobbin from which the yarn is being drawn is in
the low position, in other machines these conditions are
opposite. Thus, in the cop winding frame made by Messrs. Douglas
Fraser &amp; Sons, Ltd., Arbroath, and illustrated in Fig. 25,
the spinning bobbins are below the cops, the tapered noses of the
latter are upwards in their cones or shapers, and the yarn guides
are near the top of the machine. This view shows about
three-fourths of the full width of a 96-spindle machine, 48
spindles on each side, two practically full-length cops and one
partially built. The illustration in Fig. 26 is the
above-mentioned opposite type, and the one most generally
adopted, with the spinning bobbins as shown near the top of the
frame, the yarn guides in the low position, and the point or
tapered nose of the cop pointing downwards. Six spindles only
appear in this view, which represents the machine made by Messrs.
Urquhart, Lindsay &amp; Co., Ltd., Dundee, but it will be
understood that all machines are made as long as desired within
practicable and economic limits.</p>

<p>The spindles of cop machines are gear driven as shown clearly
in Fig. 26; the large skew bevel wheels are keyed to the main
shaft, while the small skew bevel wheels are loose on their
respective spindles. The upper face of each small skew bevel
wheel forms one part of a clutch; the other part of the clutch is
slidably mounted on the spindle. When the two parts of the clutch
are separated, as they are when the yarn breaks or runs slack,
when it is exhausted, or when the cop reaches a predetermined
length, the spindle stops; but when the two parts of the clutch
are in contact, the small skew bevel wheel drives the clutch, the
latter rotates the spindle, and the spindle in turn draws forward
the yarn from the bobbin, and in conjunction with the rapidly
moving yarn guide and the inner surface of the cone imparts in
rapid succession new layers on the nose of the cop, and thus the
formed layers of the latter increase the length proportionately
to the amount of yarn drawn on, and the partially completed cop
moves slowly away from its cup or cone until the desired length
is obtained when the spindle is automatically stopped and the
winding for that particular spindle ceases. Cops may be made of
any length and any suitable diameter; a common size for jute
shuttle is 10 in. long, and 1-5/8 in. diameter, and the angle
formed by the two sides of the cone is approximately 30
degrees.</p>

<h2><a name="gWARP" href="#WARPg">CHAPTER XIII. WARPING, BEAMING
AND DRESSING</a></h2>
<p>There are a few distinct methods of preparing warp threads on
the weaver's beam. Stated briefly, the chief methods are--</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i2">1. The warp is made in the form of a chain on a
warping mill,</p>
<p class="i6">and when the completed chain is removed from the
mill it is</p>
<p class="i6">transferred on to the weaver's beam.</p>
</div>
<br>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i2">2. The warp is made in the form of a chain on a
linking</p>
<p class="i6">machine, and then beamed on to a weaver's beam.</p>
</div>
<br>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i2">3. The warp yarns are wound or beamed direct from
the large</p>
<p class="i6">cylindrical "rolls" or "spools" on to a weaver's
beam.</p>
</div>
<br>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i2">4. The warp yarns are starched, dried and
beamed</p>
<p class="i6">simultaneously on to a weaver's beam.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The last method is the most extensively adapted; but we shall
describe the four processes briefly, and in the order
mentioned.</p>
<p>For mill warping, as in No. 1 method, from 50 to 72 full
spinning bobbins are placed in the bank or creel as illustrated
to the right of each large circular warping mill in Fig. 27. The
ends of the threads from these bobbins are drawn through the eyes
of two leaves of the "heck," and all the ends tied together. The
heck, or apparatus for forming what is known as the weaver's
lease, drawer's lease, or thread-by-thread lease, is shown
clearly between the bobbin bank and the female warper in the
foreground of the illustration. The heck is suspended by means of
cords, or chains, and so ranged that when the warping mill is
rotated in one direction the heck is lowered gradually between
suitable slides, while when the mill is rotated in the opposite
direction the heck is raised gradually between the same slides.
These movements are necessary in order that the threads from the
bobbins may be arranged spirally round the mill and as
illustrated clearly on all the mills in the figure. The
particular method of arranging the ropes, or the gearing if
chains are used, determines the distance between each pair of
spirals; a common distance is about 1-1/2 in. There are about 42
spirals or rounds on the nearest mill in Fig. 27, and this number
multiplied by the circumference of the mill represents the length
of the warp.</p>
<a name="FIG._27"></a>
<p class="ctr"><a href="images/f27.PNG"><img src="images/f27.PNG"
width="40%" alt="FIG. 27 A ROW OF MODERN WARPING MILL"></a><br>
</p>
<h3>FIG. 27 A ROW OF MODERN WARPING MILLS</h3>
<p>At the commencement, the heck is at the top, and when the
weaver's lease has been formed on the three pins near the top of
the mill with the 50 to 72 threads (often 56), the mill is
rotated by means of the handle and its connections shown near the
bottom of the mill. As the mill rotates, the heck with the
threads descends gradually and thus the group of threads is
disposed spirally on the vertical spokes of the mill until the
desired length of the warp is reached. A beamer's lease or "pin
lease" is now made on the two lower pegs; there may be two,
three, four or more threads in each group of the pin lease; a
common number is 7 to 9. When this pin lease has been formed, one
section of the warp has been made, the proportion finished being
(50 to 72)/x where x is the total number of threads required for
the cloth. The same kind of lease must again be made on the same
two pins at the bottom for the beginning of the next section of
50 to 72 threads, and the mill rotated in the opposite direction
in order to draw up the heck, and to cause the second group of 50
to 72 threads to be arranged spirally and in close touch with the
threads of the first group. When the heck reaches the top of the
mill, the single-thread lease is again made, all the threads
passed round the end pin, and then all is ready for repeating the
same two operations until the requisite number of threads has
been introduced on to the mill. If it is impossible to
accommodate all the threads for the cloth on the mill, the warp
is made in two or more parts or chains. It will be noticed that
the heck for the nearest mill is opposite about the 12th round of
threads from the bobbin, whereas the heck for the second mill is
about the same distance from the top. A completed warp or chain
is being bundled up opposite the third mill. When the warp is
completed it is pulled off the mill and simultaneously linked
into a chain.</p>
<p>A very similar kind of warp can be made more quickly, and
often better, on what is termed the linking machine mentioned in
No. 2 method. Such a machine is illustrated in Fig. 28, and the
full equipment demands the following four distinct kinds of
apparatus--a bank capable of holding approximately 300 spools, a
frame for forming the weaver's lease and the beamer's lease,
machine for drawing the threads from the spools in the bank and
for measuring the length and marking the warp at predetermined
intervals, and finally the actual machine which links the group
of threads in the form of a chain.</p>
<p>In Fig. 28 part of the large bank, with a few rows of spools,
is shown in the extreme background. The two sets of threads, from
the two wings of the bank, are seen distinctly, and the machine
or frame immediately in front of the bank is where the two kinds
of lease are made when desired, i.e. at the beginning and at the
end of the warp. Between this leasing frame and the linking
machine proper, shown in the foreground, is the drawing,
measuring and marking machine. Only part of this machine is
seen--the driving pulleys and part of the frame adjoining them.
All these frames and machines are necessary, but the movements
embodied in them, or the functions which they perform, are really
subsidiary to those of the linker shown in the foreground of Fig.
28.</p>

<p class="ctr"><a href="images/f28.PNG"><img src="images/f28.PNG"

</a><br>
</p>
<h3>FIG. 28 POWER CHAIN OF WARP LINKING MACHINE</h3>
<p>Although the linking machine is composed of only a few parts,
it is a highly-ingenious combination of mechanical parts; these
parts convert the straight running group of 300 threads into a
linked chain, and the latter is shown distinctly descending from
the chute on to the floor in the figure. Precisely the same kind
of link is made by the hand wrappers when the warps indicated in
Fig. 27 are being withdrawn from the mills. Two completed chains
are shown tied up in Fig. 28, and a stock of rolls or spools
appear against the wall near the bank.</p>
<p>The completed chain from the warping mill or the linking
machine is now taken to the beaming frame, and after the threads,
or rather the small groups of threads, in the pin lease have been
disposed in a kind of coarse comb or reed, termed an veneer or
radial, and arranged to occupy the desired width in the veneer,
they are attached in some suitable way to the weaver's beam. The
chain is held taut, and weights applied to the presser on the
beam while the latter is rotated. In this way a solid compact
beam of yarn is obtained. The end of the warp--that one that goes
on to the beam last--contains the weaver's lease, and when the
completed beam is removed from the beaming or winding-on frame,
this single-thread lease enables the next operative to select the
threads individually and to draw the threads, usually single, but
sometimes in pairs, in which case the lease would be in pairs,
through the eyes of the camas or HEALDS, or to select them for
the purpose of tying them to the ends of the warp in the loom,
that is to the "thrum" of a cloth which has been completed.</p>
<p>Instead of first making a warp or chain on the warping mill,
or on the linking machine, and then beaming such warp on to the
weaver's beam or loom beam as already described, two otherwise
distinct processes of warping and beaming may be conducted
simultaneously. Thus, the total number of threads required for
the manufacture of any particular kind of cloth--unless the
number of threads happens to be very high--may be wound on to the
loom beam direct from the spools. Say, for example, a warp was
required to be 600 yards long, and that there should be 500
threads in all. Five hundred spools of warp yarn would be placed
in the two wings of a V-shaped bank, and the threads from these
spools taken in regular order, and threaded through the splits or
openings of a reed which is placed in a suitable position in
regard to the winding-on mechanism. Some of the machines which
perform the winding-on of the yarn are comparatively simple,
while others are more or less complicated. In some the loom beam
rotates at a fixed number of revolutions per minute, while in
others the beam rotates at a gradually decreasing number of
revolutions per minute. One of the latter types made by MESSRS
Urquhart, Lindsay &amp; Co., Ltd., Dundee, is illustrated in Fig.
29, and the mechanism displayed is identical with that employed
for No. 4 method of preparing warps.</p>
<p>The V-shaped bank with its complement of spools (500 in our
example) would occupy a position immediately to the left of Fig.
29. The threads would pass through a reed and then in a straight
wide sheet between the pair of rollers, these parts being
contained in the supplementary frame on the left. A similar frame
appears on the extreme right of the figure, and this would be
used in conjunction with another V-shaped bank, not shown, but
which would occupy a position further to the right, i.e. if one
bank was not large enough to hold the required number of spools.
The part on the extreme right can be ignored at present.</p>
<p>The threads are arranged in exactly the same way as indicated
in Fig. 28 from the bank to the reed in front of the rollers in
Fig. 29, and on emerging from the pair of rollers are taken
across the stretch between the supplementary frame and the main
central frame, and attached to the weavers beam just below the
pressing rollers. It may be advisable to have another reed just
before the beam, so that the width occupied by the threads in the
beam may be exactly the same as the width between the two flanges
of the loom beam.</p>

</p>
<h3>FIG. 29 WINDING-ON OR DRY BEAMING MACHINE<br>

Ltd</i>.</h3>
<p>The speed of the threads is determined by the surface speed of
the two rollers in the supplementary frame, the bottom roller
being positively driven from the central part through the long
horizontal shaft and a train of wheels caged in as shown. The
loom beam, which is seen clearly immediately below the pressing
rollers, is driven by friction because the surface speed of the
yarn must be constant; hence, as the diameter over the yarn on
the beam increases, the revolutions per minute of the beam must
decrease, and a varying amount of slip takes place between the
friction-discs and their flannels.</p>
<p>As the loom beam rotates, the threads are arranged in layers
between the flanges of the loom beam. Thus, the 500 threads would
be arranged side by side, perhaps for a width of 45 to 46 in.,
and bridging the gap between the flanges of the beam; the latter
is thus, to all intents and purposes, a very large bobbin upon
which 500 threads are wound at the same time, instead of one
thread as in the ordinary but smaller bobbin or reel. It will be
understood that in the latter case the same thread moves from
side to side in order to bridge the gap, whereas in the former
case each thread maintains a fixed position in the width.</p>
<p>The last and most important method of making a warp, No. 4
method, for the weaver is that where, in addition to the
simultaneous processes of warping and beaming as exemplified in
the last example, all the threads are coated with some suitable
kind of starch or size immediately they reach the two rollers
shown in the supplementary frame in Fig. 29. The moistened
threads must, however, be dried before they reach the loom beam.
When a warp is starched, dried and beamed simultaneously, it is
said to be "dressed."</p>
<p>In the modern dressing machine, such as that illustrated in
Fig. 30, there are six steam-heated cylinders to dry the starched
yarns before the latter reach the loom beams. Both banks, or
rather part of both, can be seen in this view, from which some
idea will be formed of the great length occupied. Several of the
threads from the spools in the left bank are seen converging
towards the back reed, then they pass between the two
rollers--the bottom one of which is partially immersed in the
starch trough--and forward to the second reed. After the sheet of
threads leaves the second reed, it passes partially round a small
guide roller, then almost wholly round each of three cylinders
arranged &deg;o&deg;, and finally on to the loom beam. Each
cylinder is 4 feet diameter, and three of them occupy a position
between the left supplementary frame, and the central frame in
Fig. 29, while the remaining three cylinders are similarly

<p>The number of steam-heated cylinders, and their diameter,
depend somewhat upon the type of yarn to be dressed, and upon the
speed which it is desired to run the yarn. A common speed for
ordinary-sized jute is from 18 to 22 yards per minute.</p>

<h3>FIG. 30 A MODERN YARN DRESSING MACHINE WITH SIX STEAM-HEATED
CYLINDERS</h3>
<p>A different way of arranging the cylinders is exemplified in
Fig. 31. This view, which illustrates a machine made by Messrs.
Charles Parker, Sons &amp; Co., Dundee, has been introduced to
show that if the warps under preparation contain a comparatively
few threads, or if the banks are made larger than usual, two
warps may be dressed at the same time. In such a case, three
cylinders only would be used for each warp, and the arrangement
would be equivalent to two single dressing machines. The two
weaver's beams, with their pressing rollers, are shown plainly in
the centre of the illustration. Some machines have four
cylinders, others have six, while a few have eight. A very
similar machine to that illustrated in Fig. 31 is made so that
all the six cylinders may be used to dry yarns from two banks,
and all the yarns wound on to one weaver's beam, or all the yarns
may be wound on to one of the beams in the machine in Fig. 31 if
the number of threads is too many for one bank.</p>

</p>
<h3>FIG. 31 DRESSING MACHINE FOR PREPARING TWO WARPS
SIMULTANEOUSLY<br>
<i>By permission of Messrs. Charles Parker, Sons &amp;
Co</i>.</h3>
<p>Suppose it is desired to make a warp of 700 threads instead of
500, as in the above example; then 350 spools would be placed in
each of the two banks, the threads disposed as already described
to use as much of the heating surface of the cylinder as
possible, and one sheet of threads passed partially round what is
known as a measuring roller. Both sheets of threads unite into
one sheet at the centre of the machine in Fig. 31, and pass in
this form on to one of the loom beams.</p>
<p>It has already been stated that the lower roller in the starch
box is positively driven by suitable mechanism from the central
part of the machine, Fig. 29, while the upper roller, see Fig.
30, is a pressing roller and is covered with cloth, usually of a
flannel type. Between the two rollers the sheet of 350 threads
passes, becomes impregnated with the starch which is drawn up by
the surface of the lower roller, and the superfluous quantity is
squeezed out and returns to the trough, or joins that which is
already moving upwards towards the nip of the rollers. The yarn
emerges from the rollers and over the cylinders at a constant
speed, which may be chosen to suit existing conditions, and it
must also be wound on to the loom beam at the same rate. But
since the diameter of the beam increases each revolution by
approximately twice the diameter of the thread, it is necessary
to drive the beam by some kind of differential motion.</p>
<p>The usual way in machines for dressing jute yarns is to drive
the beam support and the beam by means of friction plates. A
certain amount of slip is always taking place--the drive is
designed for this purpose--and the friction plates are adjusted
by the yarn dresser during the operation of dressing to enable
them to draw forward the beam, and to slip in infinitesimal
sections, so that the yarn is drawn forward continuously and at
uniform speed.</p>
<p>During the operation, the measuring roller and its subsequent
train of wheels and shafts indicates the length of yarn which has
passed over, also the number of "cuts" or "pieces" of any desired
length; in addition, part of the measuring and marking mechanism
uses an ink-pad to mark the yarn at the end of each cut, such
mark to act as a guide for the weaver, and to indicate the length
of warp which has been woven. Thus if the above warp were
intended to be five cuts, each 120 yards, or 600 yards in all,
the above apparatus would measure and indicate the yards and
cuts, and would introduce a mark at intervals of 120 yards on
some of the threads. And all this is done without stopping the
machine. At the time of marking, or immediately before or after,
just as desired, a bell is made to ring automatically so that the
attendant is warned when the mark on the warp is about to
approach the loom beam. This bell is shown in Fig. 29, near the
right-hand curved outer surface of the central frame.</p>
<p>As in hand warping or in linking, a single-thread lease is
made at the end of the desired length of warp, or else what is
known as a pair of "clasp-rods" is arranged to grip the sheet of
warp threads.</p>
<p>After the loom beam, with its length of warp, has been removed
from the machine, the threads are either drawn through the eyes
or mails of the cambs (termed gears, healds or heddles in other
districts) and through the weaving reed, or else they are tied to
the ends of the threads of the previous warp which, with the
weft, has been woven into cloth. These latter threads are still
intact in the cambs and reed in the loom.</p>
<hr>
<h2><a name="gTYIN" href="#TYINg">CHAPTER XIV. TYING-ON,
DRAWING-IN, AND WEAVING</a></h2>
<p>If all the threads of the newly-dressed warp can be tied on to
the ends of the warp which has been woven, it is only necessary,
when the tying-on process is completed, to rotate the loom beam
slowly, and simultaneously to draw forward the threads until all
the knots have passed through the cambs and the reed, and
sufficiently far forward to be clear of the latter when it
approaches its full forward, or beating up, position during the
operation of weaving.</p>
<p>If, on the other hand, the threads of the newly-dressed, or
newly-beamed, warp had to be drawn-in and reeded, these
operations would be performed in the drawing-in and reeding
department, and, when completed, the loom beam with its attached
warp threads, cambs and reed, would be taken bodily to the loom
where the "tenter," "tackler" or "tuner" adjusts all the parts
preparatory to the actual operation of weaving. The latter work
is often termed "gaiting a web."</p>
<p>There is a great similarity in many of the operations of
weaving the simpler types of cloth, although there may be a
considerable difference in the appearance of the cloths
themselves. In nearly all the various branches of the textile
industry the bulk of the work in the weaving departments of such
branches consists of the manufacture of comparatively simple
fabrics. Thus, in the jute industry, there are four distinct
types of cloth which predominate over all others; these types are
known respectively as hessian, bagging, tarpauling and sacking.
In addition to these main types, there are several other simple
types the structure of which is identical with one or other of
the above four; while finally there are the more elaborate types
of cloth which are embodied in the various structures of carpets
and the like.</p>
<p>It is obviously impossible to discuss the various makes in a
work of this kind; the commoner types are described in <i>Jute
and Linen Weaving Calculations and Structure of Fabrics</i>; and
the more elaborate ones, as well as several types of simple ones,
appear in <i>Textile Design: Pure and Applied</i>, both by T.
Woodhouse and T. Milne.</p>
<p>Six distinct types of jute fabrics are illustrated in Fig. 32.
The technical characteristics of each are as follows--</p>

"FIG. 32 SIX DISTINCT KINDS OF TYPICAL JUTE FABRICS"></a><br>
</p>
<h3>FIG. 32 SIX DISTINCT KINDS OF TYPICAL JUTE FABRICS</h3>
<p>H.--An ordinary "HESSIAN" cloth made from comparatively fine
single warp and single weft, and the threads interlaced in the
simplest order, termed "plain weave." A wide range of cloths is
made from the scrims or net-like fabrics to others more closely
woven than that illustrated.</p>
<p>B.--A "BAGGING" made from comparatively fine single warp
arranged in pairs and then termed "double warp." The weft is
thick, and the weave is also plain.</p>
<p>T.--A "TARPAULING" made from yarns similar to those in
bagging, although there is a much wider range in the thickness of
the weft. It is a much finer cloth than the typical bagging, but
otherwise the structures are identical.</p>
<p>S.--A striped "SACKING" made from comparatively fine warp
yarns, usually double as in bagging, but occasionally single,
with medium or thick weft interwoven in 3-leaf or 4-leaf twill
order. The weaves are shown in Fig. 33.</p>
<p>C.--One type of "CARPET" cloth made exclusively from two-ply
or two-fold coloured warp yarns, and thick black single weft
yarns. The threads and picks are interwoven in two up, two down
twill, directed to right and then to left, and thus forming a
herring-bone pattern, or arrow-head pattern.</p>
<p>P.-An uncut pile fabric known as "BRUSSELLETTE." The figuring
warp is composed of dyed and printed yarns mixed to form an
indefinite pattern, and works in conjunction with a ground warp
and weft. The weave is again plain, although the structure of the
fabric is quite different from the other plain cloths
illustrated. The cloth is reversible, the two sides being similar
structure but differing slightly in colour ornamentation.</p>
<p>As already indicated, there are several degrees of fineness or
coarseness in all the groups, particularly in the types marked H,
B, T and S. The structure or weave in all varieties of any one
group is constant and as stated.</p>
<p>All the weaves are illustrated in the usual technical manner
in Fig. 33, and the relation between the simplest of these weaves
and the yarns of the cloth is illustrated in Fig. 34. In Fig. 33,
the unit weaves in A, B, C, D, E and F are shown in solid
squares, while the repetitions of the units in each case are
represented by the dots.</p>

<p>A is the plain weave, 16 units shown, and used for fabrics H
and P, Fig. 32.</p>
<p>B is the double warp plain wave, 8 units shown, and shows the
method of interlacing the yarns h patterns B and T, Fig. 32. When
the warp is made double as indicated in weave <i>B</i>, the
effect in the cloth can be produced by using the mechanical
arrangements employed for weave <i>A</i>. Hence, the cloths
<i>H</i>, <i>B</i> and <i>T</i> can be woven without any
mechanical alteration in the loom.</p>
<p><i>C</i> is the 3-leaf double warp sacking weave and shows 4
units; since each pair of vertical rows of small squares consists
of two identical single rows, they may be represented as at
<i>D</i>. The actual structure of the cloth <i>S</i> in Fig. 32
is represented on design paper at <i>C</i>, Fig. 33.</p>
<p><i>D</i> is the single warp 3-leaf sacking weave, 4 units
shown, but the mechanical parts for weaving both <i>C</i> and
<i>D</i> remain constant.</p>
<p><i>E</i> is the double warp 4-leaf sacking, 2 units shown,
while</p>
<p><i>F</i> is the single warp 4-leaf sacking, 4 units shown.</p>
<p>The patterns or cloths for <i>E</i> and <i>F</i> are not
illustrated.</p>
<p><i>G</i> is a "herring-bone" design on 24 threads and 4 picks,
two units shown. It is typical of the pattern represented at
<i>C</i>, Fig. 32, and involves the use of 4 leaves in the
loom.</p>
<p>The solid squares in weave <i>A</i>, Fig. 33, are reproduced
in the left-hand bottom corner of Fig. 34. A diagrammatic plan of
a plain cloth produced by this simple order of interlacing is
exhibited in the upper part by four shaded threads of warp and
four black picks of weft (the difference is for distinction
only). The left-hand intersection shows one thread interweaving
with all the four picks, while the bottom intersection shows all
the four threads interweaving with one pick. The two arrows from
the weave or design to the thread and pick respectively show the
connection, and it will be seen that a mark (solid) on the design
represents a warp thread on the surface of the cloth, while a
blank square represents a weft shot on the surface, and <i>vice
versa</i>.</p>
<p>A weaving shed full of various types of looms, and all driven
by belts from an overhead shaft, is illustrated in Fig. 35. The
loom in the foreground is weaving a 3-leaf sacking similar to
that illustrated at <i>S</i>, Fig. 32. while the appearance of a
full weaver's warp beam is shown distinctly in the second loom in
Fig. 35. There are hundreds of looms in this modern weaving
shed.</p>

<p>During the operation of weaving, the shuttle, in which is
placed a cop of weft, similar to that on the cop winding machine
in Fig. 25, and with the end of the weft threaded through the eye
of the shuttle, is driven alternately from side to side of the
cloth through the opening or "shed" formed by two layers of the
warp. The positions of the threads in these two layers are
represented by the designs, see Fig. 33, and while one layer
occupies a high position in the loom the other layer occupies a
low position. The threads of the warp are placed in these two
positions by the leaves of the camb (termed healds and also gears
in other districts) and it is between these two layers that the
shuttle passes, forms a selvage at the edge each time it makes a
journey across, and leaves a trail or length of weft each
journey. The support or lay upon which the shuttle travels moves
back to provide room for the shuttle to pass between the two
layers of threads, and after the shuttle reaches the end of each
journey, the lay with the reed comes forward again, and thus
pushes successively the shots of weft into close proximity with
the ones which preceded.</p>

<p>The order of lifting and depressing the threads of the warp
is, as already stated, demonstrated on the design paper in Fig.
33, and the selected order determines, in the simplest cases, the
pattern on the surface of the cloth when the warp and weft yarns
are of the same colour. A great diversity of pattern can be
obtained by the method of interlacing the two sets of yarn, and a
still greater variety of pattern is possible when
differently-coloured threads are added to the mode of
interlacing.</p>
<p>To illustrate the contrast in the general appearance of a
weaving shed in which all the looms are driven by belts from
overhead shafting as in Fig. 35, and in a similar shed in which
all the looms are individually driven by small motors made by the
English Electric Co., Ltd. we introduce Fig. 36. This particular
illustration shows cotton weaving shed, but precisely the same
principle of driving is being adopted in many jute factories.</p>
<p>A great variety of carpet patterns of a similar nature to that
illustrated at C, Fig. 32, can be woven in looms such as those
illustrated in Fig. 35; indeed, far more elaborate patterns than
that mentioned and illustrated are capable of being produced in
these comparatively simple looms. When, however, more than 4
leaves are required for the weaving of a pattern, a dobby loom,
of the nature of that shown in Fig. 37, is employed; this machine
is made by Messrs. Charles Parker, Sons &amp; Co., Ltd., Dundee.
The dobby itself, or the apparatus which lifts the leaves
according to the requirements of the design, is fixed on the
upper part of the frame-work, and is designed to control 12
leaves, that is, it operates 12 leaves, each of which lifts
differently from the others.</p>

<p>A considerable quantity of Wilton and Brussels carpets is made
from jute yarns, and Fig. 38 illustrates a loom at work on this
particular branch of the trade. The different colours of warp for
forming the pattern me from small bobbins in the five frames at
the back of the loom (hence the term 5-frame Brussels or Wilton
carpet) and the ends passed through "mail eyes" and then through
the reed. The design is cut on the three sets of cards suspended
in the cradles in the front of the loom, and these cards operate
on the needles of the jacquard machine to raise those colours of
yarn which e necessary to produce the colour effect in the cloth
t correspond with the colour effect on the design paper made by
the designer. This machine weaves the actual Brussels and Wilton
fabrics, and these cloths are quite different from that
illustrated at <i>P</i>, Fig. 32. In both fabrics, however,
ground or foundation warps are required. It need hardly be said
that there is a considerable difference between the two types of
cloth, as well as between the designs and the looms in which they
are woven.[2]</p>

<p>In the weaving department there are heavy warp beams to be
placed in the looms, and in the finishing department there are
often heavy rolls of cloth to be conveyed from the machines to
the despatch room. Accidents often happen when these heavy
packages, especially the warp beams, are being placed in
position. In order to minimize the danger to workpeople and to
execute the work more quickly and with fewer hands, some firms
have installed Overhead Runway Systems, with suitable Lifting
Gear, by means of which the warp beams are run from the dressing
and drawing-in departments direct to the looms, and then lowered
quickly and safely into the bearings. Such means of transport are
exceedingly valuable where the looms are set close to each other
and where wide beams are employed; indeed, they are valuable for
all conditions, and are used for conveying cloth direct from the
looms as well as warp beams to the looms. Fig. 39 shows the old
wasteful and slow method of transferring warp beams from place to
place, while Fig. 40 illustrates the modern and efficient method.
The latter figure illustrates one kind of apparatus, supplied by
Messrs. Herbert Morris, Ltd., Loughborough, for this important
branch of the industry.</p>

<h2><a name="gFINI" href="#FINIg">CHAPTER XV. FINISHING</a></h2>
<p>The finishing touches are added to the cloth after the latter
leaves the loom. The first operation is that of inspecting the
cloth, removing the lumps and other undesirables, as well as
repairing any damaged or imperfect parts. After this, the cloth
is passed through a cropping machine the function of which is to
remove all projecting fibres from the surface of the cloth, and
so impart a clean, smart appearance. It is usual to crop both
sides of the cloth, although there are some cloths which require
only one side to be treated, while others again miss this
operation entirely.</p>
<p>A cropping machine is shown in the foreground of Fig. 41, and
in this particular case there are two fabrics being cropped or
cut at the same time; these happen to be figured fabrics which
have been woven in a jacquard loom similar to that illustrated in
Fig. 38. The fabrics are, indeed, typical examples of jute Wilton
carpets. The illustration shows one of the spiral croppers in the
upper part of the machine in Fig. 41. Machines are made usually
with either two or four of such spirals with their corresponding
fixed blades.</p>

<p>The cloth is tensioned either by threading it over and under a
series of stout rails, or else between two in a specially
adjustable arrangement by means of which the tension may be
varied by rotating slightly the two rails so as to alter the
angle formed by the cloth in contact with them. This is, of
course, at the feed side; the cloth is pulled through the machine
by three rollers shown distinctly on the right in Fig. 42. This
view illustrates a double cropper in which both the spirals are
controlled by one belt. As the cloth is pulled through, both
sides of it are cropped by the two spirals.[3] When four spirals
are required, the frame is much wider, and the second set of
spirals is identical with those in the machines illustrated.</p>

<p>The cropped cloth is now taken to the clamping machine, and
placed on the floor on the left of the machine illustrated in
Fig. 43, which represents the type made by Messrs. Charles
Parker, Sons &amp;, Co., Dundee. The cloth is passed below a
roller near to the floor, then upwards and over the middle
roller, backwards to be passed under and over the roller on the
left, and then forwards to the nip of the pulling rollers, the
bottom one of which is driven positively by means of a belt on
the pulleys shown. While the cloth is pulled rapidly through this
machine, two lines of fine jets spray water on to the two sides
of the fabric to prepare it for subsequent processes in which
heat is generated by the nature of the finishing process. At
other times, or rather in other machines, the water is
distributed on the two sides of the cloth by means of two rapidly
rotating brushes which flick the water from two rollers rotating
in a tank of water at a fixed level. In both cases, both sides of
the fabric are "damped," as it is termed, simultaneously. The
damped fabric is then allowed to lie for several hours to
condition, that is, to enable the moisture to spread, and then it
is taken to the calender.</p>

<p>The calenders for jute almost invariably contain five
different rollers, or "bowls," as they are usually termed; one of
these bowls, the smallest diameter one, is often heated with
steam. A five-bowl calender is shown on the extreme right in Fig.
41, and in the background, while a complete illustration of a
modern 5-bowl calender, with full equipment, and made by Messrs.
Urquhart, Lindsay &amp; Co., Ltd., Dundee, appears in Fig.

<h3>FIG. 44 CALENDAR</h3>
<p>The cloth is placed on the floor between the two distinct
parts of the calender, threaded amongst the tension rails near
the bottom roller or bowl, and then passed over two or more of
the bowls according to the type of finish desired. For calender
finish, the bowls flatten the cloth by pressing out the threads
and picks, so that all the interstices which appear in most
cloths as they leave the loom, and which are exaggerated in the
plan view in Fig. 34, are eliminated by this calendering action.
The cloth is then delivered at the far side of the machine in
Fig. 44. If necessary, the surface speed of the middle or
steam-heated roller may differ from the others so that a glazed
effect--somewhat resembling that obtained by ordinary ironing--is
imparted to the surface of the fabric. The faster moving roller
is the steam-heated one. For ordinary calender finish, the
surface speed of all the rollers is the same.</p>
<p>Another "finish" obtained on the calender is known as "chest
finish" or "round-thread finish." In this case, the whole length
of cloth is wound either on to the top roller, or the second top
one, Fig. 44, and while there is subjected to the degree of
pressure required; the amount of pressure can be regulated by the
number of weights and the way in which the tension belt is
attached to its pulley. The two sets of weights are seen clearly
on the left in Fig. 44, and these act on the long horizontal
levers, usually to add pressure to the dead weight of the top
roller, but occasionally, for very light finishes, to decrease
the effective weight of the top bowl. After the cloth has been
chested on one or other of the two top bowls, it is stripped from
the bowl on to a light roller shown clearly with its belt pulley
in Fig. 41.</p>
<p>There are two belt pulleys shown on the machine in Fig. 44;
one is driven by an open belt, and the other by a crossed belt.
Provision is thus made for driving the calender in both
directions. The pulleys are driven by two friction clutches, both
of which are inoperative when the set-on handle is vertical as in
the figure. Either pulley may be rotated, however, by moving the
handle to a oblique position.</p>
<p>The compound leverage imparted to the bearings of the top
bowl, and the weights of the bowls themselves, result in the
necessary pressure, and this pressure may be varied according to
the number of small weights used. The heaviest finish on the
calender, i.e. the chest-finish on the second top roller,
imitates more or less the "mangle finish."</p>

<i>By permission of Messrs. Urquhart, Lindsay &amp; Co.,
Ltd</i>.</h3>
<p>A heavy hydraulic mangle with its accumulator and made by
Messrs. Urquhart, Lindsay &amp; Co., Ltd., Dundee, is illustrated
in Fig. 45. The cloth is wound or beamed by the mechanism in the
front on to what is termed a "mangle pin"; it is reality a thick
iron bowl; when the piece is beamed, it is automatically moved
between two huge rollers, and hydraulic pressure applied. Four
narrow pieces are shown in Fig. 45 on the pin, and between the
two rollers. There are other four narrow pieces, already beamed
on another pin, in the beaming position, and there is still
another pin at the delivery side with a similar number of cloths
ready for being stripped. The three pins are arranged thus
o&deg;o, and since all three are moved simultaneously, when the
mangling operation is finished, each roller or pin is moved
through 120&deg;. Thus, the stripped pin will be placed in the
beaming position, the beamed pin carried into the mangling
position, and the pin with the mangled cloth taken to the
stripping position.</p>
<p>While the operation of mangling is proceeding, the rollers
move first in one direction and then in the other direction, and
this change of direction is accomplished automatically by
mechanism situated between the accumulator and the
helical-toothed gearing seen at the far end of the mangle. And
while this mangling is taking place, the operatives are beaming a
fresh set, while the previously mangles pieces are being stripped
by the plaiting-down apparatus which deposits the cloth in folds.
This operation is also known as "cuttling" or "faking." It will
be, understood that a wide mangle, such as that illustrated in
Fig. 45. is constructed specially for treating wide fabrics, and
narrow fabrics are mangled on it simply because circumstances and
change of trade from time to time demand it.</p>

Ltd</i>.</h3>
<p>The high structure on the left is the accumulator, the
manipulation of this and the number of wide weights which are
ingeniously brought into action to act on the plunger determine
the pressure which is applied to the fabrics between the bowls or
rollers.</p>
<p>Cloths both from the calender and the mangle now pass through
a measuring machine, the clock of which records the length passed
through. There are usually two hands and two circles of numbers
on the clock face; one hand registers the units up to 10 on one
circle of numbers, while the slower-moving hand registers 10, 20,
30, up to 100. The measuring roller in these machines is usually
one yard in circumference.</p>
<p>If the cloth in process of being finished is for use as the
backing or foundation of linoleum, it is invariably wound on to a
wooden centre as it emerges from the bowls of the calender,
measured as well, and the winding-on mechanism is of a friction
drive somewhat similar to that mentioned in connection with the
dressing machine. Cloths for this purpose are often made up to
600 yards in length; indeed, special looms, with winding
appliances, have been constructed to weave cloths up to 2,000
yards in length. Special dressing machines and loom beams have to
be made for the latter kind. When the linoleum backing is
finished at the calender, both cloth and centre are forwarded
direct to the linoleum works. The empty centres are returned
periodically.</p>
<p>Narrow-width cloths are often made up into a roll by means of
a simple machine termed a calenderoy, while somewhat similar
cloth, and several types of cloths of much wider width, are
lapped or folded by special machines such as that illustrated in
Fig. 46. The cloth passes over the oblique board, being guided by
the discs shown, to the upper part of the carrier where it passes
between the two bars. As the carrier is oscillated from side to
side (it is the right hand side in the illustration) the cloth is
piled neatly in folds on the convex table. The carriers may be
adjusted to move through different distances, so that any width
or length of fold, between limits, may be made.</p>
<p>Comparatively wide pieces can be folded on the above machine,
but some merchants prefer to have wide pieces doubled lengthwise,
and this is done by machines of different kinds. In all cases,
however, the operation is termed "crisping" in regard to jute
fabrics. Thus, Fig. 47, illustrates one type of machine used for
this purpose, and made by Messrs. Urquhart, Lindsay &amp; Ca.,
Ltd., Dundee. The full-width cloth on the right has obviously two
prominent stripes--one near each side. The full width cloth
passes upwards obliquely a triangular board, and when the cloth
reaches the apex it is doubled and passed between two bars also
set obliquely on the left. The doubled piece now passes between a
pair of positively driven drawing rollers, and is then "faked,"
"cuttled," or pleated as indicated. The machine thus
automatically, doubles the piece, and delivers it as exemplified
in folds of half width. In other industries, this operation is
termed creasing and, rigging. Some of the later types of crisping
or creasing machines double the cloth lengthwise as illustrated
in Fig. 47, and, in addition, roll it at the same time instead of
delivering it in loose folds.</p>

<p>If the cloth is intended to be cut up into lengths, say for
the making of bags of various kinds, and millions of such bags
are made annually, it is cut up into the desired lengths, either
by hand, semi-mechanically, or wholly mechanically, and then the
lengths are sewn at desired places by sewing machines, and in
various ways according to requirements.</p>

<h3>FIG 48 SEMI-MECHANICAL BAG OR SACK CUTTING MACHINE<br>
<i>By permission of Messrs. Urquhart, Lindsay &amp; Co.
Ltd</i></h3>
<p>Fig. 48 illustrates one of the semi-mechanical machines for
this purpose; this particular type being made by Messrs.
Urquhart, Lindsay &amp; Co., Ltd., Dundee. About eight or nine
different cloths are arranged in frames behind the cutting
machine, and the ends of these cloths passed between the
horizontal bars at the back of the machine. They are then led
between the rollers, under the cutting knife, and on to the
table. The length of cloth is measured as it passes between the
rollers, and different change pinions are supplied so that
practically any length may be cut. Eight or nine lengths are thus
passed under the knife frame simultaneously, and when the
required length has been delivered, the operative inserts the
knife in the slot of the knife frame, and pushes it forward by
means of the long handle shown distinctly above the frame and
table. He thus cuts eight or nine at a time, after which a
further length is drawn forward, and the cycle repeated. Means
are provided for registering the number passed through; from
36,000 yards to 40,000 yards can be treated per day.</p>
<p>The bags may be made of different materials, e.g. the first
four in Fig. 32. When hessian cloth, II, Fig. 32, is used, the
sewing is usually done by quick-running small machines, such as
the Yankee or Union; each of these machines is capable of sewing
more than 2,000 bags per day. For the heavier types of cloth,
such as sacking, <i>S</i>, Fig. 32, the sewing is almost
invariably done by the Laing or overhead sewing machine, the
general type of which is illustrated in Fig. 49, and made by Mr.
D. J. Macdonald, South St. Roque's Works, Dundee. This is an
absolutely fast stitch, and approximately 1,000 bags can be sewn
in one day.</p>

<h3>FIG. 49 OVERHEAD (LAING) SACK SEWING MACHINE<br>

<p>The distinctive marks in bags for identification often take
the form of coloured stripes woven in the cloth, and as
illustrated at <i>S</i>, Fig. 32. It is obvious that a
considerable variety can be made by altering the number of the
stripes, their position, and their width, while if different
coloured threads appear in the same cloth, the variety is still
further increased.</p>
<p>Many firms, however, prefer to have their names, trade marks,
and other distinctive features printed on the bags; in these
cases, the necessary particulars are printed on the otherwise
completed bag by a sack-printing machine of the flat-bed or
circular roller type. The latter type, which is most largely
used, is illustrated in Fig. 50. It is termed a two-colour
machine, and is made by Mr. D. J. Macdonald, Dundee; it will be
observed that there are two rollers for the two distinct colours,
say red and black. Occasionally three and four-colour machines
are used, but the one-colour type is probably the most
common.</p>

<h3>FIG. 50 SACK PRINTING MACHINE<br>
<i>By Permission of Mr. D. J. Macdonald</i>.</h3>
<p>The ownership of the bags can thus be shown distinctly by one
of the many methods of colour printing, and if any firm desires
to number their bags consecutively in order to provide a record
of their stock, or for any other purpose, the bags may be so
numbered by means of a special numbering machine, also made by
Mr. D. J. Macdonald.</p>
<p>The last operation, excluding the actual delivery of the
goods, is that of packing the pieces or bags in small compass by
means of a hydraulic press. The goods are placed on the lower
moving table upon a suitable wrapping of some kind of jute cloth;
when the requisite quantity has been placed thereon, the top and
side wrappers are placed in position, and the pumps started in
order to raise the bottom table and to squeeze the content
between it and the top fixed table. From 1 1/2 ton to 2 tons per
square inch is applied according to the nature of the goods and
their destination. While the goods are thus held securely in
position between the two plates, the wrappers a sewn together.
Then specially prepared hoops or metal bands are placed round the
bale, and an ingenious and simple system, involving a buckle and
two pins, adopted for fastening the bale. The ends of the hoop or
band are bent in a small press, and these bent ends are passed
through a rectangular hole in the buckle and the pins inserted in
the loops. As soon as the hydraulic pressure is removed, the bale
expands slightly, and the buckled hoop grips the bale
securely.</p>
<p>Such is in brief the routine followed in the production of the
fibre, the transformation of this fibre, first into yarn, and
then into cloth, and the use of the latter in performing the
function of the world's common carrier.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

     http://www.gutenberg.net/etext06

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

     http://www.gutenberg.net/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
     http://www.gutenberg.net/2/4/6/8/24689
